1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,296
Good evening, everyone. Welcome again to this

2
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:11,560
evening session on spiritual warfare.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,940
If we could switch over to the slides.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,632
I hope everyone had a good day and I

5
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:22,648
hope that as you have gone through the day, you have

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,300
been a little bit more aware of the attacks of the devil

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,402
and that as he has attacked you, you've been able to run to

8
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:33,270
Jesus and ask for his help. Amen.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,210
Okay, well, we're going to get right into it this evening and just

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,042
want to ask you to bow your heads forward of prayer as I pray up

11
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,270
here. Let's pray.

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,226
Father in heaven, I thank you for bringing each and every one of us here.

13
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:51,938
I thank you for your blessing upon our day and I thank

14
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:55,600
you for your protection. Father, I ask that as we look

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,216
at this topic of spiritual warfare, please send

16
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:02,752
us your Holy Spirit. We pray that your Holy Spirit will fill

17
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,952
our hearts and that you will open our eyes,

18
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,952
open our ears, help us to be able to see the message that you're trying

19
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:14,080
to give to us. And I pray that you would convict our hearts

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,648
of any unconfessed sin and any open

21
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,714
doors. As we go through tonight's session, Father,

22
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:25,110
I pray that you will speak to our hearts and help us each individually

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,630
to be able to see any open doors that we have that

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,742
we need to confess that we may be keeping open so

25
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:36,342
that demons have access to our lives. And I pray, Father, that you

26
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:39,990
would shut those doors and that you will give

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,430
us freedom from the enemy. I pray that you would please

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,846
surround this place with your holy angels. I pray that your holy angels would drive

29
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,794
any evil spirits that are here trying to

30
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:55,670
disturb, trying to confuse, trying to deceive.

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,378
I pray, Father, that you would drive them out from this place. In the name

32
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:02,882
of Jesus, our Lord and Savior. I thank you, Father,

33
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:04,950
in Jesus name, Amen.

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,986
Okay, so yesterday we looked at how

35
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:15,710
demons are able to attack us and how are they able to attack us

36
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,594
through our thoughts.

37
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,226
Right. Why are they able to attack us

38
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,794
through the open doors that we have in our lives? And tonight

39
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:30,170
we're going to look at what are those open doors?

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,202
What are the types of open doors or the types of doors that we can

41
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:37,802
open to allow demons to take control of

42
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:41,184
our minds and then eventually take control of our bodies?

43
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,440
Okay, so we're going to look into.

44
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,268
I'm sorry, look, we're going to look into how we

45
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:49,920
can.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,036
We're going to look into how we can close

47
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,280
these doors as well. Right. And so the importance of

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,652
closing the open doors in our lives. And what are those open doors,

49
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:09,070
that's basically what we're going to be looking at. Okay,

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,718
So I want to review just

51
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:16,126
briefly the diagram that we looked

52
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,462
at yesterday. And that is negative

53
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:23,210
thoughts, right? Where do negative thoughts come from?

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,478
The devil and his evil spirits, Right.

55
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,902
And how can they have access to our

56
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:35,730
lives? Open doors. Okay. And we'll have a look at some quotes around

57
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,170
that. And what kind of open doors? Well, that's what we're going to touch on

58
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,430
tonight. But how do I counteract those

59
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,106
open doors or how do I counteract the negative thoughts that the devil is

60
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,994
hitting our minds with every single day? I need to counteract

61
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,450
that with positive thoughts from God.

62
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,658
Right? The only way to neutralize these negative thoughts is

63
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:02,142
really to memorize scripture,

64
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,910
to read scripture, to put the word of God into our hearts,

65
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,166
right? And when we hide the word of God in our hearts through

66
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:14,622
memorization, through self Bible study, in our

67
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:18,370
devotion time, through teaching the Bible, through preaching,

68
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,038
through praying, through claiming Bible verses, then God

69
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:26,462
will neutralize the negative thoughts in our

70
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:29,670
minds, right? And many times when we find that

71
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,958
we can't overcome the negative thoughts in our minds that really take

72
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:37,782
control of our bodies, it is because we are not spending

73
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:41,542
enough time in the word of God. Right? It is the word of

74
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,390
God that's going to neutralize us. Now,

75
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,958
yesterday we talked about how possession will

76
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:52,054
be kind of an end result of, you know,

77
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:55,744
years and years of addiction, years and years of

78
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,644
receiving the negative thoughts in our minds,

79
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:03,100
in our hearts. But the other thing I want to point out as well

80
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,652
in the red is that it creates a false identity in

81
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:10,012
us, right? So we start to

82
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:13,740
believe that it's better. We start

83
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,180
to believe that it's better off that we kill ourselves, right?

84
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,180
For those who are dealing with suicide thoughts because they have been receiving

85
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,636
these suicide thoughts and they. It's become so much a part

86
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,608
of their identity, right? When we allow thoughts

87
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:32,384
of lust to come into our minds, then we create

88
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:35,100
the false identity that we are,

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,040
you know, we are a person of lust, right?

90
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,088
And that goes both ways, by the way, both for heterosexual

91
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:46,720
and homosexuality, right? A homosexual that

92
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,192
says, you know, I was born with this. What they're really saying is I had

93
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,652
so many thoughts in my life that I have embraced that has become my

94
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:57,172
identity, right? So any sort of,

95
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,900
any sort of sin, any sort of false identity,

96
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,916
negative identity, non biblical identity, it is just simply

97
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,500
because we have received these thoughts over and over again and

98
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,556
we have learned to embrace those thoughts,

99
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:16,452
right? So from a biblical standpoint, nobody is born with homosexuality,

100
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:20,002
but they may have had trauma, they have, may have had,

101
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,430
you know, watched movies or

102
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,190
television shows over and over again until the thoughts start coming

103
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,758
into their mind, and then they embrace those thoughts and

104
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:33,990
it becomes their false identity. And then they justify that

105
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,886
by saying, I'm born with it. Right?

106
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,758
And the same thing for any other. Any other thought

107
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:44,982
of any other sorts of sins in our lives

108
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,938
that we embrace. Right. If I'm a compulsive

109
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:52,618
liar, then really I've just been

110
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:56,682
opening my mind to embrace the

111
00:06:56,786 --> 00:07:00,426
temptations to lie. Right? And over time, I just allow

112
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:03,946
that to be. To form my false identity.

113
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:07,590
Okay, sorry, coming back to here.

114
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,350
Imaginations and fantasies, right?

115
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,548
I don't necessarily have to just receive thoughts

116
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,520
to then transition to imaginations and fantasies.

117
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,596
Movies help us cut straight to fantasies

118
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:30,480
and imaginations. That's really what the devil is trying to do.

119
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,308
If we get addicted to movies or we love to watch movies and we open

120
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:38,644
our minds to movies, then movies will start to imprint

121
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:42,148
on our minds, the imaginations and

122
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:45,284
shortcut us from having lots of negative thoughts

123
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:49,588
straight into imaginations and fantasies and then eventually into

124
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:53,040
that single act that then progresses to.

125
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,100
To a habit and addiction. Right.

126
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,680
Now, I. I've been sharing this at a school

127
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,332
before, in the afternoon, before I come into the evening to some

128
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:09,190
kids. And one of the kids asked a very interesting question today

129
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,530
in the sharing that I was given. She said, well,

130
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,850
if I have suicide thoughts and that translates into imagination into

131
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,546
the single act, then how am I going to develop a habit

132
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:25,210
out of it? That was an interesting question in

133
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,350
that I want to help you to understand that really

134
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,031
what are the single acts of suicide? How does it begin?

135
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:36,971
They start to cut themselves. And so the compulsion

136
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:40,399
comes to cut their arms.

137
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:44,875
And that really is as a result. So sometimes

138
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,939
a lot of the compulsions, as I am doing the counseling,

139
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,779
help me to understand possibly where the sources have

140
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:56,939
come from. And generally in kids, when I see them cutting themselves,

141
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,120
the compulsion is coming from horror movies.

142
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,828
And so they've been watching a lot of horror movies, and there is

143
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:09,052
a. The demons are coming straight into their hearts and

144
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:12,396
taking control. Right. Other times, other things that I've

145
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,880
seen is a lot of stress in the home.

146
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,268
As you know, parents are fighting, talk of divorce and

147
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:23,660
their young kids that the.

148
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,748
The demons will start to put it into their minds that it's their fault.

149
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:32,068
Especially if the parents are arguing over their kids,

150
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:35,492
right? Or the one parent starts to point at the

151
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:39,060
child and say, it's your fault because we're arguing.

152
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,692
Right? And then the demons will come and start to put it into their minds.

153
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:46,720
Right. So it is extremely damaging for

154
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,396
children when parents are having strife in the home and

155
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:54,360
even more damaging when they're talking about divorce.

156
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,430
And this is why the devil has attacked the

157
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,870
families, because it destroys the children and it

158
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,182
weakens their minds and then the demons are

159
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:09,262
able to come and start to wreak all sorts of havoc in

160
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:12,638
their lives. Right. And so if you are having children

161
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:17,198
that are leaving the church or are having children that are dealing with depression

162
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:21,342
or mental illness, a good place to start with searching

163
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:24,480
why this is happening is how has been your

164
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,288
relationship with your spouse. And that probably is

165
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:32,384
one of the sources or you know, the causes of

166
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:36,000
the things that the children are viewing. Negative thoughts.

167
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,552
Here's an example of a list of negative thoughts. I'm not going to go

168
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:43,152
into all of these again.

169
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,832
I'm thankful for the children because as I went through this list, they were examining

170
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,272
me on each of these points and what

171
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:53,812
it means. Now what I

172
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,160
think one of the things they called out was,

173
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,948
let's see, I'm not good enough

174
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:04,484
or I am good enough.

175
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:08,644
I think there's two here. I'm better than others.

176
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:11,972
Right. So that was. Or I am good enough. Right. So they were asking how

177
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:15,284
can it be a negative thought to be saying I'm not good enough and then

178
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:18,932
I am good enough. Well, what I mean by

179
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:22,660
this is the negative thought is when it's creating a

180
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,692
negative behavior or a negative feeling in

181
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:30,100
the heart. Right. So I'm not good enough. Of course, I think,

182
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,068
you know, we, we can connect with that. But I am good enough.

183
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:38,004
Meaning I don't need anybody else. I don't need God in my life.

184
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:41,988
Right. I'm fine. I don't need God. I'm. My life

185
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:45,132
is good enough. Right? Right. So that has, that's the

186
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:48,764
flip side of I'm not good enough. Right. I am self sufficient.

187
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,012
I don't need anybody else in my life. So two types of

188
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:55,692
characters will react in a I'm not good enough and

189
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,436
I'm going to jump into depression or another type of personality type.

190
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,620
And I've often found that those who could get

191
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,476
possessed are actually of a specific personality type.

192
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:09,480
And I'll try to come back to that later,

193
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,412
towards the end of the week. Okay. But there are certain types of

194
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:17,844
personality types that tend to gravitate into depression

195
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:21,396
or into being possessed.

196
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,836
Right. But the other personality type will react in a different

197
00:12:24,908 --> 00:12:27,764
sort of way if the demons come and attack. And they will say, you know

198
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:30,900
what, I'm going to fight through this on my

199
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,400
own strength and I'M going to just push through this.

200
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,950
And I don't need God, right? And I am good

201
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,606
enough. And that's the flip side. And both are extremes

202
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:46,462
of where we really want to be, which is, Lord, I'm not good

203
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:49,710
enough, but I need. But Jesus is good enough, right?

204
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,182
Or I shouldn't. I shouldn't think that

205
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,302
I'm good enough. I need Jesus. So they both have

206
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:59,822
to gravitate towards the center, which is, I need Jesus in

207
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,370
my life. And if Jesus in my life, then I can live,

208
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,290
you know, I can live a perfect life in Christ.

209
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,410
Okay, so these are a list of types of negative thoughts.

210
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,902
Source of negative thoughts John 8. 44. Ye are of

211
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:19,470
your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father, ye will do.

212
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,974
He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,

213
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:27,166
because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh

214
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:31,430
of his own, for he is a liar and father of it.

215
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,338
So the source of negative thoughts is, of course,

216
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,762
from Satan and the demons, and they're always going

217
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:42,282
to be lies trying to create a false sense

218
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:45,722
of identity. So all negative thoughts are lies of the devil.

219
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,642
Although it feels real, we need to learn to rebuke them.

220
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:53,258
And a lot of times, the reason why it takes so long

221
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:56,664
as I'm counseling with somebody, why it takes them so

222
00:13:56,672 --> 00:14:00,040
long to get to the point of freedom, is because they're dealing with

223
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,336
all of these lies, and it has been so real

224
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,300
in their life. For example,

225
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,920
the girl that I was talking with you about yesterday, with the

226
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,232
crushing pain on her heart, that was real.

227
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,328
And so it's really hard to come

228
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:21,960
to terms with the fact that reality is

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,090
a lie, it's a false identity, and that I

230
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,370
can actually have victory through that. And I

231
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,082
liken it to the fact that, you know, this smokescreen that

232
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:35,330
the demons put in front of us is so real. I mean,

233
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,938
some of us feel it, right? Or others,

234
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:41,250
that thought is ingrained in their mind for so

235
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,914
long that it's hard to give up that false identity.

236
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:48,370
These lies that have been really becoming a reality

237
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,158
in their lives over decades. So negative thoughts are lies that become

238
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:55,374
our beliefs. And these beliefs over time form a false

239
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:59,198
identity. And we are miserable as a result

240
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:02,370
and have no hope in the promises of God.

241
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,006
So Jesus, what about Jesus? Did he deal with negative thoughts?

242
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,142
Did he have negative situations in his life?

243
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,534
Definitely, right? You know,

244
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:16,462
he was born to an unwed mother.

245
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:20,264
Is the perception that people thought, right, that Joseph

246
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:22,820
only married Mary because,

247
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,888
you know, she was with child and that's why

248
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:30,072
he married her. No biological

249
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:33,780
father that was not his father. Because, you know, she.

250
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,096
You know, nobody knows the origin. And so they. They talked

251
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:43,080
about him not really having that biological father. He experienced

252
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,938
living as a refugee in Egypt. He was tempted

253
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:50,906
in the desert. He struggled to surrender to the father's

254
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:54,506
will. And he felt alone and abandoned by those closest

255
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,458
to him. And he was betrayed by his friend and

256
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:01,722
sold for the price of a slave. So here

257
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:05,098
he could have been tempted into all of these

258
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:08,970
things, right? He was tempted to numb his pain. When his situation

259
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,640
seemed hopeless, he was offered the vinegar to

260
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,464
drink to dull his pain, and he refused that. He had difficulty

261
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:20,192
breathing. He cried out because he felt like God had

262
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:24,048
forsaken him. And so you can imagine the types of negative thoughts

263
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,296
that are going through Jesus mind as he's going through the Gethsemane

264
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:30,260
experience, as he's going through to the cross.

265
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,464
You know what kind of thoughts the devil was putting in his mind,

266
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:38,520
right? And then when Satan is tempting him, he comes to the wilderness

267
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,100
and he says, if you are right and causing

268
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,040
him to want to react,

269
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,544
retaliate, right? Because Jesus, by that time, he knows in his heart he

270
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:53,288
is the Son of God. But here comes Lucifer to say,

271
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:56,872
if you are the Son of God, meaning prove to me

272
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:03,128
that you're the Son of God. So Jesus dealt with spectacular,

273
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:07,315
amazing temptations that we will never understand what it feels

274
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,003
like, right? Because we're not God. All along,

275
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:13,747
Lucifer was trying to tempt him to use his own

276
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:17,987
divine power instead of relying on the Father.

277
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,699
For us, it's kind of easy to rely on the Father, to rely on God

278
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,539
because we have no divine power and we have no possibility of being able

279
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,571
to help ourselves out of our situations. And it's pretty obvious

280
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:33,199
once we continue in our life, but Jesus,

281
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:37,464
he had the option to use his divinity. And so

282
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:41,368
the greatest temptation of Jesus life was not to tap into his

283
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:45,100
divinity. Ellen White says when Jesus was on the cross,

284
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,192
all he needed to do was flick his eyelids

285
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,872
and legions of angels would have come and destroyed

286
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:56,264
everybody there, right? That was how close

287
00:17:56,432 --> 00:18:00,238
he could have come to just ending it all for everyone there.

288
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:04,114
As he's on the cross and he's feeling that pain, he could not flick

289
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:08,178
his eyelids in the wrong way because if he did that with

290
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:11,746
a glance of his change of his expression,

291
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,310
the angels would have willingly come down and destroyed all of them.

292
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,790
That was the temptation that Jesus dealt with.

293
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,930
I want to show you some as I've been studying desire mages over the last

294
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,406
couple of years. God has revealed to me after

295
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,910
I've had that experience with spiritual warfare, God has just,

296
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,686
you know, opened my eyes to how Ellen White gives

297
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,286
us indications of spiritual warfare as we are going

298
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:42,454
through, as you go through the book, Desire of Ages. So I just want to

299
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:46,598
show you some quotes. This is about John the Baptist, and he's

300
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:50,502
in prison. And this is what Ellen White says. There were hours when

301
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:54,036
the whispering of demons tortured his spirit

302
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:57,716
and the shadow of a terrible fear crept over him.

303
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:00,680
So as John the Baptist was in prison,

304
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,120
a prophet of the Lord who was faithful,

305
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,212
the demons were still able to insert thoughts

306
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:11,380
into his mind. The whispering of demons.

307
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,316
Here's another one. Many among Christ's hearers who are dwellers

308
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:18,692
at Jerusalem and who are not ignorant of the plots

309
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:22,312
of the rulers against him, felt themselves drawn to him by

310
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:25,816
an irresistible power. The conviction pressed upon

311
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:29,464
them that he was the son of God. But Satan was ready

312
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:33,128
to suggest doubt, Right? And so we see here

313
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:37,272
in the crowd as they're listening to Jesus, they felt conviction.

314
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:41,128
But then suddenly thoughts came in of doubts about

315
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:44,360
who Jesus was. When the

316
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,770
Lord is about to do a work, Satan moves upon someone to object.

317
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,690
And this is talking about Martha, right? So when Jesus says, roll away

318
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,242
the stone, Martha says, but Lazarus has been dead for so

319
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:59,826
long, right? And this is the commentary that Eloi

320
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:03,270
gives. And then Jesus says, take ye the stone.

321
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,754
Take ye away the stone. Christ said, as far as possible,

322
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:10,482
prepare the way for my work. But Martha's positive and ambitious

323
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,642
nature asserted itself. She was unwilling that

324
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,938
the decomposing body should be brought to view, right?

325
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:21,066
So she objects. And then Ellen White says she objects because

326
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,842
Satan inserted the thought into her mind.

327
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:28,670
Speak up and object. Okay,

328
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,306
this is talking about the council of the Sanhedrin.

329
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:37,082
At this council council, Christ's enemies had been deeply

330
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:40,388
convicted. The Holy Spirit had impressed their minds,

331
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:43,460
but Satan strove to gain control of them.

332
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,300
He urged upon their notice the grievances they

333
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,028
had suffered on account of Christ. Right? And then

334
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,308
she goes into detail about all the thoughts she's putting into

335
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:58,084
their minds of the Sanhedrin as they are deliberating

336
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:01,812
what to do with Jesus, Satan takes control of their mind.

337
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:04,756
And you see, right at the very end, you can't really see it clearly,

338
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:09,278
but it says all this Satan now brought to their minds,

339
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:12,878
right? Helping us to understand all of us deal with

340
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:17,422
negative thoughts. It's whether you embrace them or whether you recognize

341
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,650
them for what's going on.

342
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,690
Sorry, I'm going to skip this slide.

343
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,534
Okay, so we're going to talk about open doors. Now, so we talked about negative

344
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:33,356
thoughts and I gave you some evidence of it again

345
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:36,560
in desire of ages. So what are open doors?

346
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,708
It says here In Adventist Hope 402, paragraph 1

347
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:45,840
and 2, Satan cannot enter the mind without our consent.

348
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,660
We should present before the people the fact that God has provided

349
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,196
that we shall not be tempted above what we are able to bear,

350
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:56,732
but that with every temptation he will make a way

351
00:21:56,756 --> 00:22:00,694
of escape. If we live wholly for God, we shall

352
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:04,742
not allow the mind to indulge in selfish imaginations.

353
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:08,550
Or another way of saying that is negative thoughts.

354
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,022
If there is any way by which Satan can gain access to the

355
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:15,270
mind, he will sow his tares and cause them

356
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,142
to grow until they will yield an abundant harvest.

357
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:22,598
In no case can Satan obtain dominion over

358
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:26,712
the thoughts, words and actions unless we voluntarily

359
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,120
open the door and invite him to enter. He will then

360
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,592
come in and by catching away the good seed sown

361
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:37,336
in the heart, make of none effect the truth. So here's

362
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:41,416
where I get the term open doors. Okay, so demons

363
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:44,984
can take control of our lives. Demons can take control of our thoughts

364
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:49,080
and our bodies if we open the door, if we allow them

365
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,492
to come in. And we're going to look at different channels by which

366
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:56,788
they will come in. Okay, so open doors are legal

367
00:22:56,804 --> 00:23:00,580
rights. So this is not a quote, this is just me explaining to you.

368
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,548
Open doors or legal rights are known sins that are not, that have

369
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:07,800
not been confessed or forsaken by the victim.

370
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,260
The devil is legalistic. And if we have opened up doors

371
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,292
into your life through sin, the devil will not leave unless the

372
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:20,206
legal right disappears, which only happens through confession,

373
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:23,278
forsaking and receiving God's forgiveness.

374
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:26,750
After helping people understand how demons attack us through

375
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,350
our thoughts, we should next have them share with us their background and

376
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,222
childhood. And through asking the Holy Spirit discover what

377
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,726
are the open doors in their lives. So this is the next step. If you're

378
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:41,390
doing counseling, right, and you've helped the individual to understand your

379
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,622
thoughts are not your thoughts. And so, and many times the thoughts that

380
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:49,350
you're having are coming from demons. Now we want to understand

381
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,318
how are they able to gain such strong access

382
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:56,614
into our lives, right? And that is through open doors,

383
00:23:56,742 --> 00:24:00,326
then we need to lead them through a prayer of confession and renouncing

384
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:04,070
of their sins, claiming the truth that Jesus has overcome

385
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,930
every evil spirit.

386
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,200
So there are three main types of open doors.

387
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,828
The first one is what we call inherited curses or

388
00:24:14,884 --> 00:24:18,332
generational sins. The second one is sins of the

389
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,580
flesh or vows or strongholds that we keep

390
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,020
Repeating to ourselves. And then the third one is occult

391
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,332
involvement or idol worship.

392
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:32,668
So we're going to go into detail into each of these three categories.

393
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:36,252
So as I'm doing counseling, as you're talking with

394
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:39,564
a friend, as they're sharing with you, you're praying that the

395
00:24:39,572 --> 00:24:42,836
Holy Spirit will guide you to understand what

396
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:46,148
might be the possible open doors in the individual's life.

397
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:49,604
And you want to let them, you know, share openly.

398
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:52,772
Right. So you don't want to go, okay, let's talk now. Let me pull out

399
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:56,052
my list of open doors, and I will ask you a

400
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:59,636
question about each one. And you say yes or no. Right. It's not. It doesn't

401
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:03,604
work like that. You need to let them to speak freely

402
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:07,300
about their lives. Right. And as you're thinking about your life now,

403
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,612
and I ask as we go through the open doors, that you

404
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:14,426
reflect on your life. Okay. And I'm going to pause after each

405
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:18,362
section of the open doors for us to kind

406
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:22,122
of take a moment. And I'm going to pray together.

407
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:26,170
I'm going to allow you to pray individually to confess,

408
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,786
if God is impressing you, to confess at that very moment

409
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:33,946
about the open door that God has impressed you is

410
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:37,322
in your life. Right. And then I will close with a prayer. So we're going

411
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:41,294
to stop after each of these categories, and we're going to kneel together,

412
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:45,358
and I'm going to give you that time to confess. And after you

413
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:48,974
confess, I will close with a prayer and, you know,

414
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:52,462
we will command the demons to leave. Okay. So this is

415
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,910
going to be. We're going to work together on this.

416
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,366
Okay. All right. Let's talk about inherited curses

417
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:00,050
and generational sins.

418
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,050
Some parents and grandparents dedicate their children to a spirit.

419
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:11,022
So this is what happened, you know, with my wife. Her grandmother

420
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:14,350
was a witch, a witch doctor.

421
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,590
And because she had made that pact with the devil, the demons

422
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,222
laid claim to future generations.

423
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:26,830
Right. The sins of the fathers will be unto the third and the fourth generation.

424
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,494
And so she was able to see demons growing up. All of the.

425
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:33,790
All of her female cousins were able to see demons growing up.

426
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,610
And this was normality for them.

427
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,286
An evil spirit involved in an ancestor's life will often try to work

428
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:45,806
with the children when the ancestor dies. Sins of parents

429
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:49,358
can be weaknesses that evil spirits pressure the children

430
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:52,734
to commit. And this is where we get it from Exodus

431
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:55,950
20:5. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them,

432
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,294
nor serve them. For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous

433
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:03,344
God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto

434
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:06,860
the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.

435
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,512
So any sort of generational sins that

436
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,272
we commit that can be passed on to future generations,

437
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:17,728
and the demons will continue to try

438
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:21,312
to trouble future generations. So in the Bible,

439
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,592
we have many examples of generational sins as

440
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:28,626
well. Abraham, he lied to his wife, and then Isaac lied

441
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:32,018
about his wife, and then Jacob lied to his father.

442
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:35,602
Jacob's sons lied to Jacob about Joseph being killed.

443
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,722
And Jacob's sons lie to a whole town of men

444
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:42,626
before killing them. Likewise, King David

445
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:46,070
committed sexual sin with Uriah's wife, Bathsheba,

446
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,906
and then Amnon, David's son,

447
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:53,714
raped his half sister, Tamar. Absalom slept with David's

448
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:57,910
concubines. Solomon had thousands of wives and concubines.

449
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,926
And then many innocent babies died in the fires of Moloch because of Solomon's

450
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:05,750
wives being pagan and promoting child sacrifice.

451
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,142
So the sins of the fathers will go into the

452
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:13,078
next generation. The next generation. The next generation. Right. Both from

453
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:16,998
a DNA perspective, but also from

454
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:20,742
the demons continuing to come after the children as

455
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:24,752
well. So if we want to break that cycle, we need to pray and

456
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:28,752
ask God to break the bondage that

457
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:32,224
has been kind of the demons have put upon the family,

458
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:35,380
and they're going after successive generations.

459
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,700
Okay? So a simple prayer would go like this.

460
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,192
If we find out that we have generational sins, and the

461
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:48,160
strongest one really is if you know that there's any witchcraft in the family for

462
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,060
fortune telling, any of that, or you know that

463
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,544
parents are having any sort of generational sins,

464
00:28:56,592 --> 00:29:00,240
whether it be lying, adultery, or stealing

465
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,840
or drugs or any of these things, you want to pray that

466
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,280
God will break that bondage, that God will break

467
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,008
that stronghold that the enemy has over your family,

468
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:14,570
and that it ends in your generation because you don't want to pass

469
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,410
it to your future generations. Amen. We do not want

470
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,602
our children to have to suffer from the generational

471
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:27,190
sins that have been passed on to us. Right. And often when

472
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,194
I'm doing counseling with somebody, you know, when we're having

473
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:35,130
hatred with our parents or we're getting frustrated or angry

474
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,586
with how they're living their lives as we're

475
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:42,122
changing, I want you to remember generational

476
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:45,898
sins, which means that most likely, even though you

477
00:29:45,954 --> 00:29:50,650
see it in them, they're a victim of their past generation.

478
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,538
And so we need to have empathy. We need to realize that

479
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:58,506
although the things they're doing may be hurting us

480
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:02,190
or maybe as children or even a spouse,

481
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,210
we have to look at them as a victim. Right.

482
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,162
And we need to Realize that the generation before and

483
00:30:10,186 --> 00:30:13,470
the generation before is perpetuating this.

484
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,314
And you know, because they have grown up seeing it,

485
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,310
right? You know, they,

486
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,470
you know, girls who grow up in with sexual abuse,

487
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,762
although they are angry with what has happened to them,

488
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:31,202
they will grow up to then perpetuate it, or they

489
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,980
will grow up and go into prostitution, even though they hated the

490
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,228
fact that this has happened to them. By beholding,

491
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:41,680
we become changed, right? It's both a law for

492
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,052
good things, spiritual things, but it's also a law for negative

493
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:49,716
things, right? And so we need the power of Jesus to break

494
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:54,100
this pattern so that it doesn't pass on to future generations.

495
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,956
Okay? So I'm going to ask you to kneel with me now, and I'm

496
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:02,174
going to ask if the Holy Spirit has convicted your hearts,

497
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:05,486
that you need to confess this sin. You need to ask Jesus

498
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:09,198
to break this generational sin that's

499
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:12,798
in your family that you would have that silent prayer. So I'm

500
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:15,710
going to open with a short prayer and I'm going to give you a few

501
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,894
minutes to confess that sin.

502
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:23,214
And you may even read this silently if you want, as a template

503
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:26,776
and where it has that long line, you just put that

504
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,840
generational sin in there, okay? And then you confess that and

505
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,824
you ask Jesus to break that hold. And I will pray

506
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:38,712
at the end of it and will command the demons to leave. Okay?

507
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:42,580
So let's kneel together and we're going to pray this together.

508
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,456
Father in heaven, I pray for your Holy

509
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:52,040
Spirit to be with us now. I pray that your Holy Spirit will move

510
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,470
upon our hearts. And as we spend a few moments in

511
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,734
prayer individually, silently, I pray,

512
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:02,830
Father, that you will move upon our hearts the generational sins

513
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,718
that we need to confess or we need to surrender and

514
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:10,798
ask you to break those curses or break the stronghold of the enemy

515
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:14,254
over our lives. And so, Father, please send

516
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:18,110
your Holy Spirit to convict our hearts right now as we spend a

517
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,572
moment in silent prayer.

518
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,150
Father in heaven, I thank you for moving upon each of our hearts.

519
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,630
And Father, you have heard each of our prayers individually

520
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,930
and you desire to set us free. And because

521
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,562
we have confessed the sins before you personally

522
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:52,682
to you, you cover us with the blood of

523
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:56,346
Jesus. And I claim, First John 1:9, if we confess

524
00:34:56,378 --> 00:35:00,746
our sins, you are faithful

525
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:04,954
and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness.

526
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,994
And because you have cleaned us in the name of Jesus Christ,

527
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:11,786
Father, I pray that you would rebuke the evil spirits

528
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:15,082
that may have come in as a result of These generational sins or that have

529
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:19,018
been plaguing us have been surrounding us, have been

530
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:22,722
taking control of our minds and our bodies. And in the name

531
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,922
of Jesus Christ, evil spirits that have come in as a

532
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:29,122
result of generational sins, I command you in the name of

533
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:33,330
Jesus to go. The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan,

534
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,202
and you have no power over us. Our hearts belong to

535
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:40,590
Jesus. We have recommitted our hearts to him.

536
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,482
And Jesus is in our hearts and he will

537
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:47,950
set us free. Thank you Father for hearing our prayer.

538
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,810
For this we pray in Jesus name. Amen.

539
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,610
Okay, you may be seated.

540
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,770
So here's an important Bible text to memorize,

541
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,606
and it's part of a scripture song that we often sing.

542
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:11,094
2 Corinthians 10, 3, 6. For though we walk in the

543
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,742
flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are

544
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:18,098
not carnal, but mighty. Through God to the pulling down of

545
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:22,210
strongholds, casting down imaginations, and every high

546
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,882
thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity

547
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:30,722
every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a

548
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:33,970
readiness to revenge all disobedience when

549
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,362
your obedience is fulfilled. So do remember

550
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:40,866
this Bible text and quote

551
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,994
it, especially the part where it says the pulling down of strongholds

552
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:48,258
and the casting down of imaginations and bringing into

553
00:36:48,314 --> 00:36:51,630
captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.

554
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,910
Okay, Sins of the flesh. Sure. Yeah, go ahead.

555
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,430
No worries.

556
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,750
Okay. Sins of the flesh.

557
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,702
Sins of the flesh. Here are some examples of

558
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:15,622
the sins of the flesh with the Bible verses with it. So we

559
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:19,142
have anger, envy, pride, gossip and criticism.

560
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:23,142
Bitterness, greed, rebellion, appetite and

561
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:26,902
lust. Strife, Unforgiveness. Use of

562
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:30,758
addictive drugs, also related to appetite or certain forms of

563
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:34,182
music and movies. All of these can

564
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:37,300
be sins of the flesh. Now,

565
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,496
the most powerful one that I see over and over again is

566
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:44,872
unforgiveness. Because it's really hard

567
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:48,680
to detect unforgiveness in your life because

568
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,296
it's such an invisible sin. And most of us don't act

569
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:55,860
out our unforgiveness, but we're just holding it in

570
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,056
and we don't respond. We may not outwardly

571
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:04,044
respond to it, but in the home or wherever we are,

572
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:06,840
we're going to act it out.

573
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,120
And it's sometimes something that we hold inside and

574
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,036
we don't share about it. It's one of those really powerful

575
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:20,252
invisible sins. And generally that's kind of

576
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:24,028
the go to one that is in my mind, especially when I'm

577
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:27,836
talking to somebody who's dealt with abuse or somebody who's

578
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:32,004
dealt with trauma their childhood. Unforgiveness generally

579
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,960
is the most powerful sin that is there.

580
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,868
And either it manifests itself as

581
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:43,380
unforgiveness for ourselves, or it manifests as unforgiveness

582
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,124
towards the person that's done

583
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:49,780
whatever they've done to us. Okay,

584
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,300
now I want to show you a bunch of.

585
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,930
Yesterday I told you that I went through the spirit of prophecy and searched for

586
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,590
names of demons, right? And so I'm going to quickly kind of go through.

587
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,574
We won't read all of it, but I want to show you all the demons

588
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:09,662
that Ellen White names throughout the spirit of prophecy.

589
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:13,422
Okay? So we have a demon of strife. And this is the only demon

590
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:17,470
named in Adventist home, okay? And it

591
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,524
says here, the demon of strife will be kept out of the family and.

592
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:24,512
And no separation of interest will take place. No alienation of affection

593
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:28,820
will be permitted if the law of God is obeyed.

594
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,072
Okay? So in every family there is a demon

595
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:36,752
of strife. And if we as a family are

596
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:40,528
doing our morning and evening worship together, if we

597
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:44,192
are praying, if the father, the priest of the home is praying for

598
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:48,234
his children, as Job did, then God would guard

599
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:52,906
the family, and the demon of strife will have less capability

600
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,730
to be able to attack. But what we have to understand is that in

601
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,110
every family, whenever a husband and wife argues,

602
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,354
it is not because of the husband and wife that they are arguing.

603
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:07,130
It is because of the demon of strife. And the sooner we pick

604
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,010
up on that, and maybe many of us have gone through our marriage for a

605
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,642
long time without realizing it. But you have to

606
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:17,312
understand, as soon as you start to argue, you have to notify

607
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,992
yourself or pray that God will give you the awareness that

608
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:24,464
the demon of strife is the one stirring everyone, okay?

609
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:28,980
And so we have to remember that demon of intemperance.

610
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,296
He can give us help to conquer even this terrible demon

611
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:39,060
of intemperance. So we have a demon of intemperance.

612
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,592
I will give you these slides so you don't have to take the

613
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:50,896
photo. Demon of appetite. There is a demon of appetite

614
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:54,848
that attacks all of us. And when you find that you cannot control

615
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:58,848
your appetite, there is most likely a demon of appetite there.

616
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:02,624
Or when you have addictions for drugs, for alcohol,

617
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,208
that is a demon of appetite. Demon of

618
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,220
selfishness,

619
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,902
describing Judas. If he would open his heart to Christ, divine grace would

620
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:16,710
banish the demon of selfishness. And even Judas might become a

621
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,130
subject of the kingdom of God.

622
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,690
Demon of greed,

623
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,130
demon of jealousy, talking about Saul.

624
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,656
Demon of jealousy, talking about Saul and his jealousy

625
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:44,256
of David. So every time he got taken over or possessed,

626
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,060
it was the demon of jealousy,

627
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,540
Demon of passion. Okay, so this is talking about

628
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,826
Saul. Still, this intelligence aroused the demon of passion

629
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:04,266
that had been slumbering in Saul's breast. So the demon

630
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:07,630
of jealousy led to the demon of passion or anger.

631
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,310
Demon of unkindness.

632
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,370
Some who profess to be servants of Christ have so long cherished

633
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,336
the demon of unkindness that they seem to love the unhallowed

634
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:29,000
element and to take pleasure in speaking words that displease

635
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,016
and irritate. So this could be a

636
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:37,260
bad habit of ours. Demon of evil and cruelty.

637
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,740
So talking about the effects of alcohol.

638
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,490
Demon of hysterics and satanic imagination imaginings.

639
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,502
Demon of ambition. For those

640
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:05,278
of us who really have our own ambitions and

641
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:07,902
where we want to be. We want to have a million bucks. We want to

642
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:11,678
become a millionaire or a billionaire. We want to have this car, that car,

643
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:14,450
how many houses? Demon of ambition.

644
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,980
Demon of heresy. False theology.

645
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,408
Those of us who are struggling with false theology and wanting to share

646
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:27,940
that the demon of heresy is behind that.

647
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,220
Demon of rebellion.

648
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,820
Demon of lust.

649
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,990
So as I said, demon of lust goes both ways. Whether it's

650
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,430
those who cannot control their desire for

651
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,474
premarital sex or those who are dealing with homosexuality.

652
00:43:54,602 --> 00:43:57,550
Same demon. Demon of hatred.

653
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:07,710
Demon of pride, vanity, anger.

654
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,212
Here we have the demon of jealousy. This one

655
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:20,280
is an interesting one. Selfishness is a demon whose name is legion.

656
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,204
So selfishness has gathers

657
00:44:25,252 --> 00:44:29,400
together a powerful legion of demons.

658
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,360
We have a tobacco demon.

659
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,330
We have a demon of wine.

660
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,422
Demon of appetite. We've talked about that already. Demon of

661
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:50,366
intemperance. Okay,

662
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:54,158
so let's

663
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:58,510
have a read of this. You know this counsel from Elamite,

664
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,902
it says, it has been clearly presented to me that God's people are to take

665
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:05,808
a fruit firm stand against meat eating. Would God for 30

666
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:09,184
years give his people the message that if they desire to have pure

667
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:12,272
blood and clear minds, they must give up the use of

668
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:16,112
flesh meat if he did not want them to heed this message? By the

669
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:19,904
use of flesh meats, the animal nature is strengthened and the spiritual

670
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:23,104
nature is weakened. So what is the purpose of flesh

671
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:26,672
meat in our time, especially the poisonous flesh meat that

672
00:45:26,696 --> 00:45:29,898
we're all eating and also, by the way, the non

673
00:45:29,954 --> 00:45:33,274
biblically prepared flesh meat. If you want to have flesh

674
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:37,290
meat and you want to have clean meat, please go to a kosher butcher.

675
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,290
If you take meat from anybody else, it is not biblically

676
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,162
prepared and therefore it is sin. So any

677
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:49,130
meat with blood still in it. So your juicy steaks any

678
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,350
meat with fat still on it. Kfc, chicken.

679
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:56,240
It is sin. We are not supposed to be eating meat in that way.

680
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,256
If you really want to have meat, please go and find a kosher butcher,

681
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:03,744
of which in Malaysia we can't find any because we're a Muslim country

682
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:07,020
and there are no Jews in our country.

683
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,960
But in this country, if you really want to eat clean meat,

684
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,864
please go and find a kosher butcher. Otherwise you are not eating

685
00:46:14,912 --> 00:46:18,432
meat in the right way. But by the way, in this time and

686
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:22,490
age, if you are eating meat, it is weakening the spiritual

687
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,750
nature, thus preparing us to

688
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,834
fall into temptation a lot easier and

689
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:33,402
repeated. Falling into temptation then becomes addiction.

690
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:38,270
Addiction then becomes possession. All of it ends at possession.

691
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,954
Forgiveness. So as I said, unforgiveness is one of

692
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:46,400
the most powerful sins that

693
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,500
many people that I counsel with are holding onto.

694
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,772
And the true form of forgiveness, the prayer that we need to pray if

695
00:46:54,796 --> 00:46:58,676
we want to have the forgiveness of Christ is what he prayed

696
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:02,644
on the cross. Luke 23, verse 34. Father, forgive them,

697
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:06,068
for they know not what they are doing, right?

698
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,204
Jesus gave us the model prayer for forgiveness, which is,

699
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:12,286
lord, I don't like what they did to me,

700
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:16,286
Lord, they have hurt me terribly. Lord, they have abused me.

701
00:47:16,438 --> 00:47:19,982
But forgive them, because they did not know what they were doing.

702
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,438
They may have been an agent of Satan, they may have been doing wicked things,

703
00:47:23,494 --> 00:47:26,958
they may have consciously done what they're doing,

704
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,462
but really they did not know that they were under the control of Satan,

705
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:34,462
right? They did not realize the depth to which they

706
00:47:34,486 --> 00:47:37,672
were hurting us. Otherwise, quite possibly,

707
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:41,384
they would not have done it. So we cannot forgive

708
00:47:41,432 --> 00:47:45,272
in our own strength. Christ depended on the Father's strength to forgive,

709
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:48,792
asked for the forgiveness of Christ, just like we ask

710
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:52,232
for the faith of Jesus. Forgiveness was so

711
00:47:52,256 --> 00:47:55,864
important that Christ took time out from dying on the cross

712
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:59,992
to utter these words for our example. So no matter how

713
00:48:00,016 --> 00:48:03,586
painful our situation, nothing will compare

714
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:07,202
with Christ's situation. So once we

715
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:11,394
utter the words, father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,

716
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:14,690
we will feel that relief, right? God will

717
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,066
give us that relief to our hearts. And even if we don't,

718
00:48:18,178 --> 00:48:21,650
we ought to continue to pray it until we believe

719
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,218
it, until it becomes a part of us. Remember,

720
00:48:25,394 --> 00:48:28,510
when we choose to take on the

721
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,214
thoughts of unforgiveness, then we are forming

722
00:48:32,262 --> 00:48:36,022
that false identity of unforgiveness. You want to overcome that,

723
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:39,670
Then you need to start to pray the prayer of forgiveness until that

724
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,270
becomes your identity, until God makes

725
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:46,790
it our identity. And this is one of the most important Things

726
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,342
that generally when I'm doing counseling that we have to

727
00:48:50,366 --> 00:48:53,542
come to terms with. Okay,

728
00:48:53,606 --> 00:48:57,008
so again, I want to spend a bit of time now in

729
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:00,560
prayer. And I want to ask you to kneel with me

730
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,320
once again. If the Holy Spirit is convicting your hearts on

731
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,904
the open doors in your life, I'm going

732
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:11,488
to give you a little bit longer because sins of the flesh,

733
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:15,520
longer. List here. And if Holy Spirit is convicting your

734
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,740
heart of any of these sins of the flesh,

735
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,362
please confess it. And after you confess it,

736
00:49:22,466 --> 00:49:26,074
I will close with prayer and we will ask God to rebuke

737
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:29,610
those demons and command them to leave us. Amen. All right,

738
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,550
let's kneel together and pray.

739
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:44,042
Father in Heaven, once again I want to thank you for

740
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:47,098
the blood of Jesus. And I thank you for his death

741
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:51,330
upon the cross, that he paid the price for all of our sins.

742
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,530
So if we choose to hang on to

743
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,850
the sins that we have committed,

744
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,158
it is our foolishness. It is to our detriment.

745
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,190
And so, Father, I'm praying at this very moment, if there are demons

746
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,222
that are surrounding us, that are hardening our hearts,

747
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:16,112
in the name of Jesus Christ, please, Father, bind those demons

748
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:20,044
and command them to leave so that we can feel the conviction

749
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:23,292
of youf Spirit. Father, we need you'd spirit to

750
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:26,680
convict us because many times we are living under

751
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,732
self deception and we're living under the lies

752
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:34,716
of the enemy. So please clear out those demons now. Send you'd holy

753
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:38,620
angels here to drive them away so that all

754
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,080
of us can feel the conviction of youf Holy Spirit.

755
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,746
Father, we submit this time into your hands. Please show us

756
00:50:45,898 --> 00:50:49,270
the sins of the flesh that we ought to confess.

757
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,584
Father in heaven, I thank youk that

758
00:53:50,592 --> 00:53:54,152
yout are a prayer answering God, and that yout have been hearing each one

759
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:57,688
of our prayers and it is yous desire to set

760
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:01,656
us free. Father, I thank youk for 1 John 4:18,

761
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:05,336
where youe've told us there is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth

762
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:08,594
out fear, because fear hath torment. And he that feareth

763
00:54:08,642 --> 00:54:11,762
is not made perfect in love. And we

764
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:14,994
love him because he first loved us. Thank you, Father,

765
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:18,754
for first loving each one of us. And Lord, I thank

766
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:22,466
you that as we have confessed our sins, you have covered

767
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:25,762
us with the blood of Jesus, and you fill our hearts with your love and

768
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:29,154
your peace. And Father, once again

769
00:54:29,242 --> 00:54:32,552
we claim 1 John 1:9. And we

770
00:54:32,576 --> 00:54:35,992
thank you that you have forgiven us of our sins and cleansed us

771
00:54:36,016 --> 00:54:40,300
of unrighteousness. And we thank you that you cover us with the blood of Jesus.

772
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,100
And because of that, in the name of Jesus Christ,

773
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,928
Father, we ask that you would command the demons

774
00:54:48,104 --> 00:54:50,540
to leave our hearts,

775
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,392
to break the bondage of the enemy, to destroy

776
00:54:56,456 --> 00:54:59,712
the strongholds in our hearts. And in the name of

777
00:54:59,736 --> 00:55:03,296
Jesus Christ, I command any demons that have been

778
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:06,912
here as a result of the flesh sins of the flesh.

779
00:55:07,056 --> 00:55:11,136
In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave now and

780
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:14,752
you will no longer trouble us because we have confessed and

781
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:18,016
we are now covered by the blood of Jesus and he

782
00:55:18,088 --> 00:55:21,312
has freed us from all of you in the name

783
00:55:21,336 --> 00:55:25,270
of Jesus Christ. I thank you, Father, and we

784
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,410
pray all of these things in his name. Amen.

785
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,982
Okay, you may be seated. We're going to

786
00:55:33,006 --> 00:55:37,610
take a short break. I hope as you've gone through this exercise

787
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,690
that you are feeling a little lighter.

788
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:45,798
As we confess our sins, Jesus is

789
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:49,862
freeing us from the burdens and the bondage

790
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:53,452
of the enemy. And you should feel the peace of God in your

791
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:57,532
hearts. You should feel lighter. And as

792
00:55:57,556 --> 00:56:00,956
we take a short break, I pray that you will continue to ask

793
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:05,276
Jesus to speak to your hearts and all of our hearts

794
00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:08,924
to convict us if there are any further

795
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:13,164
unconfessed sins in our lives or any open doors

796
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:16,332
that we may have not confessed yet. And we

797
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:18,440
will go into the last one, which is,

798
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,764
oh, sorry, there's vows and strongholds when we come back.

799
00:56:22,852 --> 00:56:25,948
And then we will deal with the occult. Okay, so let's

800
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:29,260
take a short break, five minute break. And we'll come back

801
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,588
again at 7:40. Let's bow our heads for a short word

802
00:56:32,604 --> 00:56:36,012
of prayer. Father in heaven, please be with us, refresh our

803
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:39,500
minds as we take a short break. Help us to be able to continue

804
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,590
to concentrate and be able to hear your voice as

805
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:47,046
we go through the rest of this seminar. For this we pray in Jesus name.

806
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:47,850
Amen.

807
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:09,664
Okay, let's bow our heads forward of prayer, shall we Father?

808
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:12,960
Once again, as we spend time to study this

809
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,432
topic of spiritual warfare, I pray for your holy angels to be

810
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:20,624
here. I pray that your Holy Spirit would move upon hearts.

811
00:57:20,752 --> 00:57:24,576
And I pray that you'll drive out the enemy from here and

812
00:57:24,728 --> 00:57:28,304
that they would not be able to disturb us. They would not be able to

813
00:57:28,392 --> 00:57:32,320
interfere or deceive us. And I pray also for the equipment,

814
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,664
Lord, that you would sustain it and do not allow the

815
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:39,730
enemy to interfere there either. We submit this time into

816
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,470
your hands. For this we pray in Jesus name. Amen.

817
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,670
Okay, what are vows and strongholds?

818
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,722
Vows. Making a promise to do something, a commitment to

819
00:57:50,746 --> 00:57:54,946
do something that can create a pattern of thinking that ends up controlling

820
00:57:54,978 --> 00:57:59,010
us through our lives. Okay, so here are common vows

821
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,870
that I commonly hear from people that I counsel. I will

822
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,730
not let anyone get close to me or hurt me again.

823
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,010
I will use my anger to protect myself from being hurt.

824
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,974
In the case for my wife, it was I will use unforgiveness

825
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:17,542
as a wall of protection to protect myself

826
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:21,462
from being hurt. I'm alone and I will never trust anyone so

827
00:58:21,486 --> 00:58:25,062
no one can hurt me. I will always be on guard against being

828
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:28,622
hurt again, being rejected again. I will

829
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:32,878
hurt others or take from others before they can hurt me or take me.

830
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:36,398
So any sort of like things that you just keep repeating to yourself over

831
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:39,982
and over and over again, that starts to define who

832
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:43,130
you are and especially in a negative way.

833
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:47,182
Conversely, we can repeat Bible texts that will

834
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:49,998
create an identity in us as well, right?

835
00:58:50,054 --> 00:58:53,566
God is love. Or behold, what manner

836
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:57,170
of love is this? That we should be called the sons and

837
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:00,402
daughters of God. And so if we repeat that,

838
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:04,050
that becomes our identity. But often the

839
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,810
demons will put in our minds how they want us to be

840
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:13,346
right, and that will end up becoming our identity strongholds.

841
00:59:13,538 --> 00:59:16,514
Kind of similar really, vows,

842
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:20,070
strongholds, but it's just a repeated pattern.

843
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,700
And this is more maybe actions here. So shutting down emotionally

844
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,692
when we're stressed or when we're frustrated,

845
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:31,756
withdrawing and isolating ourselves from people and preventing

846
00:59:31,788 --> 00:59:35,372
them from helping us. Not wanting to open up

847
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:39,480
to anybody, reacting with anger anytime we have

848
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,484
little things happen that doesn't seem to go our way,

849
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:47,324
we're going to blow up. Blaming everyone else instead of owning

850
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:50,678
our part, Trying to control others around me,

851
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:54,214
turning to food for comfort. Right,

852
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:58,726
so bulimia or what's

853
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:02,886
the other one? Anorexia, right? Not eating food,

854
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:06,710
self pity and feeling sorry for ourselves. This can

855
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,910
be a pretty powerful one as well, especially for someone

856
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,030
who's dealt with abuse. You know, self pity

857
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,252
sometimes can be an open door. Trying to

858
01:00:16,276 --> 01:00:19,052
please others, to gain acceptance or approval,

859
01:00:19,196 --> 01:00:23,148
trying to rescue others and fix others instead of ourselves.

860
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:26,892
Instead of realizing that we have brokenness and we have problems that

861
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,412
we need to fix, we're just looking at everybody else. And this tends to

862
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:34,060
be a problem for those in ministry. By the way, not wanting to deal

863
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,468
with who the brokenness in our, you know,

864
01:00:37,524 --> 01:00:41,470
our lives and wanting to go around to help everybody else

865
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,770
can be a way that we're trying to deflect the problem from

866
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:49,098
being able to heal. Getting lost in too much work. Video games,

867
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:52,810
pornography, Facebook, Instagram, social media. A lot of times

868
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:56,586
these addictions is not because I'm simply Addicted

869
01:00:56,618 --> 01:01:00,394
to social media. There is broken in my brokenness in my life that's

870
01:01:00,442 --> 01:01:04,538
driving me towards that. And I need to pray for wisdom, asking God,

871
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:07,868
what is it? What is it, Lord, that you

872
01:01:07,924 --> 01:01:11,692
need me to deal with in my life? The brokenness,

873
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:16,252
taking from others, depending on others all the time, instead of being responsible

874
01:01:16,316 --> 01:01:20,364
for my own life. So these are different strongholds

875
01:01:20,412 --> 01:01:24,284
that the enemy with repeated negative thoughts can

876
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:27,040
put into our hearts and our minds.

877
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,514
We're going to move on to the occult stuff.

878
01:01:34,642 --> 01:01:38,146
So I'm not going to pause here. We will combine

879
01:01:38,178 --> 01:01:40,590
this with the occult side of things.

880
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:44,834
Okay, so occult involvement and idolatry.

881
01:01:44,882 --> 01:01:48,690
This is kind of the third big area. And here's kind

882
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:52,402
of a list of things. This is by no means an

883
01:01:52,426 --> 01:01:55,970
exhaustive list, but a kind of suggestion,

884
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,440
a suggestive list to you. Protective protection through amulets,

885
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,580
strings and tattoos or all sorts of other

886
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,540
things from all of our different cultures

887
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,472
could be an open door. So for my wife, that was

888
01:02:12,576 --> 01:02:16,440
the rosary beads, that was one of the open doors for

889
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,720
her. But there are in other cultures,

890
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,752
especially in Southeast Asia, you can go and get these amulets or

891
01:02:23,776 --> 01:02:27,950
these bracelets that will give you power or energy.

892
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:32,178
Those could be open doors, you know, the new

893
01:02:32,234 --> 01:02:36,350
age crystals that have energy in there.

894
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,450
Meditation could be an open door.

895
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,922
And also there

896
01:02:43,946 --> 01:02:49,250
are some of the things that we've seen for

897
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:53,478
tattoos. I'm not talking about just any tattoos. There are

898
01:02:53,614 --> 01:02:56,918
places that will tattoo you that also will give you power

899
01:02:57,054 --> 01:03:00,374
as well. So we had a Bible worker that we had to

900
01:03:00,382 --> 01:03:04,130
do deliverance for, and he had over the course of his life,

901
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:08,810
flown to Thailand to see a tattoo

902
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:13,142
person who would kind of bless that tattoo and it

903
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:16,646
would give them power. And so we had to pray over each of those tattoos,

904
01:03:16,758 --> 01:03:19,994
and he had to confess for getting those tattoos.

905
01:03:20,102 --> 01:03:23,522
And then we rebuked and cast out the demon that came in as

906
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:27,138
a result of that tattoo. So it's kind of tattoos

907
01:03:27,154 --> 01:03:30,482
that are blessed. But of course, also if you're tattooing on

908
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:34,530
yourself, cultic symbols, the all

909
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:38,630
seeing eye, you know, so a lot of the spots,

910
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:43,506
personalities nowadays, you can see, you know, they're tattooing

911
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:46,976
all sorts of things on their bodies. All Seeing Seeing Eye

912
01:03:47,168 --> 01:03:49,300
or the Masonic symbols,

913
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,960
you know, that, you know, there's something going

914
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,352
on there as well. And so we need to be careful of those in

915
01:03:56,376 --> 01:03:59,584
general, of course, don't do any tattoos. I was going to

916
01:03:59,592 --> 01:04:02,912
ask, what is strings related with tattoos and amulets? Okay,

917
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:06,592
so in the Chinese culture, they believe that

918
01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:10,512
if you go to bed and you tie a String on your toe, then the

919
01:04:10,536 --> 01:04:13,220
spirits will reveal to you who is your wife.

920
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,292
So these are. That's. I put that in

921
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:21,732
there because, you know, in certain cultures they believe in

922
01:04:21,836 --> 01:04:23,120
certain things like that.

923
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,340
Okay. In Thailand, they wear devil

924
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,924
strings. Okay, so there you go. Right. So it's

925
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:35,120
cultural. And I'm sure over here, the,

926
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,780
you know, American Indians, they would have their things as

927
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:43,852
well that they would be able to relate to idols and items connected to

928
01:04:43,876 --> 01:04:47,644
idolatry. So if you came from a

929
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:51,520
different religion before coming into Christianity,

930
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,100
into the Adventist faith, and you had idols, then you

931
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:59,548
need to ask God to forgive you for worshiping

932
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:02,684
those idols. And you need to ask God to break any bonds

933
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:06,396
of demons that had come in. So for my mom, she was Buddhist before

934
01:05:06,468 --> 01:05:09,794
she got baptized. When she was bullied at school,

935
01:05:09,882 --> 01:05:14,034
she came home, she prayed to the ancestors and demons

936
01:05:14,082 --> 01:05:17,282
came in as a result. Spirit houses and shrines,

937
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:20,018
this is common in places like Cambodia,

938
01:05:20,194 --> 01:05:23,298
in Thailand, even in Malaysia. For the Buddhists,

939
01:05:23,474 --> 01:05:27,618
outside the house, they will have a little house for the spirit to live in.

940
01:05:27,754 --> 01:05:30,530
Worship of ancestors, fortune telling,

941
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:34,730
channeling and listening to mediums. If you've gone to get

942
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:38,650
your palm read, if you've gone to speak to the fortune tellers,

943
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,378
tarot cards, things like that, you are opening yourself up to

944
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:45,870
demon possession games involving spirits.

945
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:49,450
So Ouija boards, if you put your

946
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:53,630
finger and allow the demons to move it across letters,

947
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,810
you will get possessed as a result. That we had a girl who came

948
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:02,416
to us in our Bible school, school, I think this was in 2020,

949
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:05,696
and she had paranormal capabilities,

950
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:09,968
meaning after she played with the Ouija boards, she was

951
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:13,920
able to tell her friends an intuition that

952
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,232
she was having about what would happen to them and it would actually happen to

953
01:06:17,256 --> 01:06:21,580
them. And so she was starting to be able to tell the future.

954
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,654
And that came in as a result of her playing with the Ouija boards.

955
01:06:25,832 --> 01:06:29,242
And also she was dealing with a lot of unforgiveness in

956
01:06:29,266 --> 01:06:33,002
her life as well. Books, movies,

957
01:06:33,146 --> 01:06:36,522
especially those that are focused on spirits and witchcraft. And literally

958
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:40,378
almost every movie nowadays has an element of witchcraft

959
01:06:40,474 --> 01:06:43,930
and spiritualism, meditation that

960
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,698
empties the mind and focuses on the spirits,

961
01:06:46,874 --> 01:06:50,890
hypnosis. So anybody who's done hypnotherapy that

962
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,994
is not of God and you're going to have to confess

963
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:57,270
that, that and ask God to get rid of the demons that have come in,

964
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,658
possibly unbeknownst and not so obvious to you that have been taken

965
01:07:01,714 --> 01:07:05,786
control, certain supposed methods

966
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:09,194
of healing. So in Philippines and some parts of

967
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:13,434
the world, it's very common for Adventists to bring their sick

968
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:16,954
children to see the witch doctor. Especially if they're not satisfied

969
01:07:17,002 --> 01:07:21,072
with Western medicine, they will bring their little children over to

970
01:07:21,096 --> 01:07:24,528
see the witch doctor. And we've had quite

971
01:07:24,544 --> 01:07:27,728
a number of kids who have come to us who have been possessed since

972
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:32,000
young and have been dealing with demon possession as a result of

973
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,632
their parents bringing them to witch doctors to ask

974
01:07:35,656 --> 01:07:39,264
for healing. And then there's a long list in Deuteronomy

975
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:42,528
4, 19:18, verse 10 to 12,

976
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:46,400
and Leviticus 26, 27, and also Revelation

977
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,250
21:8. Some of those are not just on

978
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:55,226
occult and idolatry, but also on sins

979
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:57,590
of the flesh as well. Yes. Question.

980
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,750
Can we have a mic? Sorry.

981
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:13,210
What about some of the. I guess you call them

982
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:17,130
alternative medicine,

983
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,990
like acupuncture.

984
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:25,338
Acupuncture. Acupuncture actually is

985
01:08:25,394 --> 01:08:29,130
based on the philosophy that we have both yin and yang and

986
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:32,778
they're trying to balance our chi and the energy flowing through us.

987
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:36,554
So it is a. The philosophy is

988
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:40,884
wrong. So I would not be participating

989
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:44,212
in acupuncture. Any others that you caution

990
01:08:44,276 --> 01:08:47,588
against besides acupuncture? You know,

991
01:08:47,644 --> 01:08:50,788
Chinese medicine uses a lot of herbs and that's fine,

992
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:54,708
but the doctor that you may be going to may be

993
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:57,940
believing in qi and yin and yang

994
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:02,324
and balancing our hot and cold energies within our bodies.

995
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:06,610
So it's not so much the herbs themselves, but the

996
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,094
doctor that's administrating it and what his belief system

997
01:09:11,182 --> 01:09:14,646
is. So you have to be careful of those as well. So generally,

998
01:09:14,678 --> 01:09:18,530
a lot of the Eastern healing has

999
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:22,870
a different philosophy than what the Bible teaches us.

1000
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:26,214
So you have to be careful of the doctor, not so

1001
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:29,574
much the herbs, because you could use those herbs

1002
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:33,364
in natural remedies, but the doctor administering

1003
01:09:33,412 --> 01:09:37,396
that may be having a different philosophy. So what about buying products

1004
01:09:37,468 --> 01:09:40,788
for companies that have that philosophy,

1005
01:09:40,964 --> 01:09:44,532
like have herbs that they're selling or what have you. But they

1006
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,716
have that philosophy and they're. They're open. I mean, as long as you're not dealing

1007
01:09:47,748 --> 01:09:52,420
with them, you know, and those herbs are just

1008
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:56,084
what they are, herbs with nothing else, and it's not blessed or anything,

1009
01:09:56,132 --> 01:09:58,660
then you should be fine. Yeah.

1010
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,248
Any other questions on this? On the occult side of things?

1011
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:06,512
So this ranges really wide. And one of the

1012
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:10,400
big things that I've been dealing with in these

1013
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,048
last few years is speaking in tongues as well.

1014
01:10:14,184 --> 01:10:18,740
So we get a lot of Pentecostals that come to us who are having harassment,

1015
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,622
and generally when they confess this

1016
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:27,706
ideology of speaking in tongues and the spirit that has been possessing

1017
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:31,210
them when they have been speaking in tongues, they are free

1018
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:35,162
from the harassment. So speaking in tongues is also

1019
01:10:35,266 --> 01:10:38,350
a big open door for the Pentecostals,

1020
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:44,922
at least from our experience, as we've been helping those

1021
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:46,150
who have come to us.

1022
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:52,688
Any questions about the list? Anything that you've experienced

1023
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:55,488
over here? One of the big ones,

1024
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,912
another one that I've noticed that has been

1025
01:10:58,936 --> 01:11:02,460
talked about is this concept in the.

1026
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,580
I think it's South American or American Indian.

1027
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,700
I'm trying to think how to pronounce what the word is.

1028
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:15,686
Ahasuerus or something like that. Have you guys heard of that? Anybody hear of that?

1029
01:11:15,808 --> 01:11:18,346
Sorry. Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca, yeah,

1030
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:22,330
ayahuasca. So that's been. So this is where they all gather

1031
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,658
together. They go out and I think they smoke a pipe or

1032
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:29,050
they give you some sort of drug to induce

1033
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:33,034
and then you kind of pass out. And when you wake up, you literally

1034
01:11:33,162 --> 01:11:36,634
see demons speaking to you about what you should do if

1035
01:11:36,642 --> 01:11:39,898
you want to be successful. And this is quite a big

1036
01:11:39,954 --> 01:11:43,606
thing that's kind of going around, especially those, those who

1037
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:47,490
are talking about how to be rich, how to have success.

1038
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,942
Some of them actually promote this in

1039
01:11:51,966 --> 01:11:55,574
New Age. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So there's been

1040
01:11:55,582 --> 01:11:59,238
some. Yes, of course,

1041
01:11:59,294 --> 01:12:03,398
Halloween for those who participate in that. We are putting ourselves

1042
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:06,530
and our children especially on dangerous ground.

1043
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:10,758
The demons are particularly powerful on that day because

1044
01:12:10,814 --> 01:12:13,942
the witches come out in force.

1045
01:12:14,086 --> 01:12:17,382
All witches come out and they are chanting and casting

1046
01:12:17,446 --> 01:12:20,902
spells and praying on that day for the neighborhoods that they

1047
01:12:20,926 --> 01:12:22,570
are in. Yes.

1048
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:27,570
Sorry, could you use the mic? Thank you.

1049
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:32,326
I'm a massage therapist and I have done

1050
01:12:32,398 --> 01:12:36,384
work on witches and others.

1051
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,980
Now I always pray with my clients.

1052
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,216
Is there any danger in that type

1053
01:12:43,248 --> 01:12:46,688
of hands on environment? No,

1054
01:12:46,824 --> 01:12:50,500
as long as the Lord is with you. Remember what happened to Balaam?

1055
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,020
He was asked to curse God's people and he could not.

1056
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,780
And in the end, what did he do? He tried to lead them into sin.

1057
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:03,198
Right. And that opened the doors for their downfall.

1058
01:13:03,374 --> 01:13:06,862
So if you're dealing with witches, no matter what they

1059
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:09,902
try on you, they're not going to, it's not going to work. As long as

1060
01:13:09,926 --> 01:13:13,438
you're protected and you are right with the Lord, you're walking

1061
01:13:13,454 --> 01:13:16,814
with the Lord. He will protect you. And if he doesn't want you to

1062
01:13:16,822 --> 01:13:20,206
go in, if he doesn't want you to do anything, if there's danger,

1063
01:13:20,318 --> 01:13:23,470
Holy Spirit will warn us and, you know,

1064
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:26,580
tell us not to go in. Yeah. So no problem.

1065
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,800
Yes. What if

1066
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,096
you think you have a neighbor that may be practicing those Kinds of things.

1067
01:13:35,168 --> 01:13:38,420
Any suggestions in that regard? Pray for them.

1068
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,376
Yeah, I've been doing that. Yeah. So as you pray for them and

1069
01:13:42,448 --> 01:13:46,020
you ask the Lord for an opening to be able to reach out to them,

1070
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,864
the Lord will provide that opening. Yeah. So whatever

1071
01:13:49,912 --> 01:13:54,030
they're doing, it's. It's going to be nullified. They cannot do anything to you

1072
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,426
as long as you're right with the Lord. Anything they try will be neutralized

1073
01:13:59,618 --> 01:14:02,882
as well. And God will give them the

1074
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:06,530
realization that our God is more powerful

1075
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,430
and they should consider changing allegiances.

1076
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,590
What about within your own home?

1077
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:17,368
Within your own home? Yes. Within your own home? Yeah.

1078
01:14:17,384 --> 01:14:20,744
It doesn't matter. Your children? Yeah,

1079
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:24,376
it doesn't matter. Their choices. Sorry,

1080
01:14:24,408 --> 01:14:27,592
could you explain more? Is this to do with occult or not? Yeah, with the

1081
01:14:27,616 --> 01:14:30,620
occult. My son,

1082
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,584
he's watching occult things on.

1083
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:40,568
I mean, he's a grown man. He's 38 now. But because

1084
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:43,774
of drug choices, he's coming out of a dark place.

1085
01:14:43,832 --> 01:14:49,042
Place. Right. And he

1086
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:52,530
watches a lot of hypnotic

1087
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:54,630
media things on his phone.

1088
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:01,394
What? I mean, I'm praying for him.

1089
01:15:01,482 --> 01:15:05,090
Things are getting better. Over the three years that he's been with us,

1090
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:07,986
it has improved tremendously.

1091
01:15:08,178 --> 01:15:11,400
The rages and the violence have declared

1092
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:15,684
decreased tremendously. But he's

1093
01:15:15,732 --> 01:15:19,348
still addicted to this. I mean, it's something

1094
01:15:19,404 --> 01:15:22,804
on his phone and all I see is a screen with

1095
01:15:22,972 --> 01:15:26,004
some sort of. He's hearing it and I don't.

1096
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:29,040
I don't know what it is, but I know it's not good.

1097
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,532
Sure. Yeah. So look, that's. You can pray for

1098
01:15:32,556 --> 01:15:35,280
him, but ultimately it's his decision.

1099
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:39,190
But you can pray that God will bind up the demons. So your go to

1100
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,438
prayer for anybody that you're trying to reach, whether it's your own family,

1101
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:45,750
your neighbor, your friend, your spouse,

1102
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:49,398
whoever it is. You pray that God will bind up the demons so that Holy

1103
01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:53,238
Spirit can convict their hearts. Once Holy Spirit convicts their hearts,

1104
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:56,646
conversion will come. Right. You don't have to try to argue

1105
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:59,782
with them. You don't try to try to prove them wrong. The more you try,

1106
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:03,142
the worse it gets sometimes. So the best thing is pray that

1107
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:06,606
the holy. That the angels of God will drive

1108
01:16:06,638 --> 01:16:11,102
out the demons, that God himself will bind them up and neutralize their power

1109
01:16:11,286 --> 01:16:14,462
so that they can hear the conviction of the

1110
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:17,550
spirit. That's what they need. That's what we all need. Right.

1111
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:21,054
It's all what we all need when we want to overcome addiction

1112
01:16:21,182 --> 01:16:25,490
in our own lives as well, or any of our habitual sins or weaknesses.

1113
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:29,410
So pray that God will Bind up the demons. Yes.

1114
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,704
Could you use the mic? Thank you. The all seeing eye. I didn't realize,

1115
01:16:33,752 --> 01:16:37,656
but my daughter had a favorite artist in triangle with the all seeing eye

1116
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:39,960
up there, and it was in her room and it was in our house.

1117
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,432
It's not an issue now because everything's been destroyed, but this is

1118
01:16:43,456 --> 01:16:46,776
the sort of thing that certainly affected her.

1119
01:16:46,928 --> 01:16:50,536
Right? Yeah. So. And look, if you've

1120
01:16:50,568 --> 01:16:52,260
opened up your home to those things,

1121
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,186
they will start to do things in the home, right. And you'll

1122
01:16:57,218 --> 01:17:00,830
start to hear things, you'll start to feel things.

1123
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:04,738
You know, you may feel a presence. And so,

1124
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:08,434
you know, you need to. We. You need to work on cleaning house.

1125
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:12,386
Right. And so after this, I also, after the seminar, I also recommend,

1126
01:17:12,498 --> 01:17:16,114
go back to your homes, pray and ask the Lord if there is anything

1127
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:19,730
in your home. And make sure you're praying and asking the Lord, because some people

1128
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:22,510
can go a little crazy on this and start throwing out everything,

1129
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,904
but, you know, you know, pray that the Holy Spirit will convict

1130
01:17:26,952 --> 01:17:30,312
your hearts and don't, don't go crazy with throwing out

1131
01:17:30,336 --> 01:17:34,072
things. But the Holy Spirit will tell you what it is. And if you

1132
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:37,672
are feeling things in the home, then generally it means that

1133
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:40,792
there are open doors. Can we pass the

1134
01:17:40,816 --> 01:17:43,300
mic over? Thank you.

1135
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,934
Sorry. Thank you.

1136
01:17:48,072 --> 01:17:50,510
How about the. On the dollar bill?

1137
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:55,842
Well, you can stop using money if you want. Always burning a hole in their

1138
01:17:55,866 --> 01:17:59,778
pockets. Yeah, you know, it's. I don't think, I don't

1139
01:17:59,794 --> 01:18:02,882
think any. Everyone has much choice on that one. And I

1140
01:18:02,906 --> 01:18:06,930
believe that, you know, God knows that we

1141
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:09,890
all need to use money. And that's not, that's not going to be an open

1142
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:13,880
door. But we're talking about, you know, tattoos or

1143
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,516
some poster or some symbol of that. But again,

1144
01:18:17,668 --> 01:18:21,420
let the Lord convict your hearts, right. And so he

1145
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,972
will show you what are the open doors that you need to

1146
01:18:24,996 --> 01:18:27,640
deal with in your homes, especially.

1147
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,920
Okay. Any other question? Okay.

1148
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:38,812
What about when you have a family member that's constantly watching movies,

1149
01:18:38,876 --> 01:18:41,830
etc. I mean,

1150
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:47,018
I'm not the boss of them, so to speak. So what. What do you pray?

1151
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:50,762
Everything is about prayer. But make sure you're not getting in

1152
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:54,710
the way of the prayers. Right. Sometimes we feel like

1153
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,186
we need to be the ones who tell them. And as soon as we open

1154
01:18:58,258 --> 01:19:01,690
up our mouths, we start World War iii. And then you

1155
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,970
know that you are really blocking the work of the spirit. Right.

1156
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:08,242
And again, make sure that you are dealing with the open doors in

1157
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:11,750
your life because it may be that your prayer is not effective.

1158
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:15,682
Right. It may be that God can't answer your prayers because

1159
01:19:15,706 --> 01:19:18,910
it's hitting the ceiling because of the open doors in your life.

1160
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:22,386
Or it may be that the demons are getting you deflecting your

1161
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,746
attention to look at everybody else around you

1162
01:19:25,818 --> 01:19:29,330
that is more obvious than you and you're missing out the open

1163
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:33,192
doors in your life. And so we really need to ask God to search our

1164
01:19:33,216 --> 01:19:37,832
hearts and make sure that we are confessing

1165
01:19:37,976 --> 01:19:41,400
the sins that God is convicting our hearts of

1166
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,192
and reconciliation, right? If God is working through

1167
01:19:45,216 --> 01:19:49,176
us and working in our lives, there will be reconciliation

1168
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:53,340
in our families. And if you find that you are not having reconciliation

1169
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,860
in the family, then it may be

1170
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:02,390
that you need to focus on yourself,

1171
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:06,674
right? And ask God to bring about that reconciliation.

1172
01:20:06,722 --> 01:20:09,790
And it may be if the other side doesn't want to do it,

1173
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:14,114
then you need to pray harder that God will move upon their hearts,

1174
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:18,530
bind up the demons, but give you wisdom to speak,

1175
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:22,050
right? And to reconcile. So one of the also

1176
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:25,692
most powerful ways that can prevent God from answering our

1177
01:20:25,716 --> 01:20:29,388
prayers is a lack

1178
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:30,720
of reconciliation.

1179
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,764
Let me give you a story. There is a story in

1180
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:40,572
the Bible In Matthew chapter 17 and verse 14,

1181
01:20:40,676 --> 01:20:43,980
Matthew 17:14, When Jesus comes down

1182
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:47,132
the mountain from the mount of Transfiguration.

1183
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:51,120
He gets down at the bottom of the mountain, and then a father with

1184
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,464
his demoniac son comes to him and he says,

1185
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:58,672
jesus, help me, because I've been trying to get your disciples to

1186
01:20:58,696 --> 01:21:02,752
cast out the demons from my son. And they can't do it,

1187
01:21:02,936 --> 01:21:06,176
right? And the nine disciples are scratching their heads

1188
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:10,272
because they tried casting out the demon. Nothing happened, right? Then Jesus

1189
01:21:10,336 --> 01:21:13,980
proceeds into a lesson to tell the Father first

1190
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,696
that. That you have a lack of faith, right? And he says, if you pray.

1191
01:21:18,808 --> 01:21:22,824
And then the Father responds and says, I believe. Help thou, my unbelief.

1192
01:21:22,952 --> 01:21:26,280
And Ellen White says, if any of us pray that prayer,

1193
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,264
we will never be lost, right? That is a really powerful

1194
01:21:30,312 --> 01:21:34,008
promise in connection with that prayer. I believe help

1195
01:21:34,064 --> 01:21:37,432
thou, my unbelief. If we pray that prayer constantly,

1196
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:41,582
we can never be lost because we're giving God the permission

1197
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:46,066
to change our faith, right? But then after that, he proceeds

1198
01:21:46,098 --> 01:21:49,810
on and he casts out the demon out of his son. And then

1199
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:53,682
later, the disciples come to him and they say, jesus, why couldn't we

1200
01:21:53,706 --> 01:21:57,282
cast him out? And Jesus tells them, if you had the

1201
01:21:57,306 --> 01:22:00,658
faith of a mustard seed, you'd be able to move mountains.

1202
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:04,338
And these things will only come out through

1203
01:22:04,394 --> 01:22:08,274
fasting and prayer. So a lot of people think because of that

1204
01:22:08,442 --> 01:22:11,792
story that the way to deal with Demons, when you're doing

1205
01:22:11,816 --> 01:22:14,700
a deliverance is you gotta fast and pray for the person,

1206
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,864
right? But if you go to Ellen White and her commentary

1207
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:22,272
on that story, she says that the reason why

1208
01:22:22,296 --> 01:22:25,220
they couldn't cast out the demons because of jealousy.

1209
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:30,544
The nine disciples were jealous in their hearts and they were angry

1210
01:22:30,592 --> 01:22:34,464
and full of unforgiveness and hatred for the three disciples

1211
01:22:34,512 --> 01:22:38,416
who went, went up on the mount of Transfiguration. Jesus had chosen

1212
01:22:38,448 --> 01:22:41,744
the three and the nine were angry. And because of

1213
01:22:41,752 --> 01:22:46,336
their anger, because of their self pity, because if they are perceived

1214
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,900
lack of justice or equality,

1215
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,472
they started to have unforgiveness in their hearts,

1216
01:22:53,616 --> 01:22:57,072
right? And so really, and then if you look at when Jesus says, if you

1217
01:22:57,096 --> 01:23:00,224
had the faith of a Mustafi, you could move mountains, what is the

1218
01:23:00,232 --> 01:23:03,704
mountain in the story? Contextually speaking, there's only one mountain

1219
01:23:03,752 --> 01:23:07,320
there, right? Because I used to believe, oh, you know, if I

1220
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,272
had a little bit of faith, I could tell, you know, the mountain to

1221
01:23:11,296 --> 01:23:15,060
move and it's going to move into the sea. That's not what Jesus is saying.

1222
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,632
Jesus is saying, if you had a

1223
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:22,440
little bit of faith, God would have removed the mountain of

1224
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,360
jealousy from your heart, right? The mount of Transfiguration

1225
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,534
represented jealousy for those nine disciples.

1226
01:23:29,662 --> 01:23:32,862
And they couldn't shake the thought. And every as they were

1227
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:36,670
looking at the Mount of Transfiguration, they were getting angrier and angrier

1228
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,982
and angrier, right? And a lot of us, we have the

1229
01:23:40,006 --> 01:23:43,726
wrong spirit when we want to help those that we think

1230
01:23:43,798 --> 01:23:47,806
need help. And we don't realize that there is a mountain of jealousy,

1231
01:23:47,918 --> 01:23:50,810
unforgiveness, and, you know,

1232
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:55,824
reconciliation that needs to take place. And so when Jesus says,

1233
01:23:55,982 --> 01:23:59,308
these kind come out only by fasting and prayer,

1234
01:23:59,404 --> 01:24:03,840
what are they supposed to fast and pray for themselves?

1235
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,884
They're not supposed to be fasting and praying for the other person,

1236
01:24:07,972 --> 01:24:11,116
the demoniac, right? Jesus did not need them to fast

1237
01:24:11,148 --> 01:24:14,940
and pray for the demoniac. Jesus needed them to fast and pray for themselves

1238
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,132
that God would remove the mountain of unforgiveness in their hearts,

1239
01:24:19,276 --> 01:24:22,872
the mountain of unkindness

1240
01:24:22,956 --> 01:24:26,864
in their heart. Remember, there's a demon of unkindness, right? The amount of unkindness

1241
01:24:26,912 --> 01:24:31,360
in their hearts, the mountain of spiteful

1242
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,420
words or words that do not convert.

1243
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,248
They need to pray and fast for themselves before

1244
01:24:39,304 --> 01:24:43,200
they try to deal with the problems of the others, right? And often this

1245
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,208
is the case in families, right. That we think,

1246
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:49,200
okay, you know, I know the word, I know the truth,

1247
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,152
I know what's wrong with them, and I know what I need to do to

1248
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:56,072
fix them, and I tell them what I need to do to fix them.

1249
01:24:56,176 --> 01:25:00,168
But the demon of unkindness, or the demon of unkind words

1250
01:25:00,264 --> 01:25:04,820
or the demon of without

1251
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:11,096
irreconcilable differences is

1252
01:25:11,168 --> 01:25:14,280
taking over the mind and it all comes

1253
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,290
out wrong and it ends wrong. Right?

1254
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:20,970
And so what we need to do is fast and pray that

1255
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:24,170
God will change our hearts and fill our hearts with

1256
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:27,070
so much love that without speaking,

1257
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:31,146
God can move upon their hearts, remove the demons.

1258
01:25:31,338 --> 01:25:34,378
Conviction sets in. When they speak to us,

1259
01:25:34,514 --> 01:25:37,386
we can speak with kindness, right?

1260
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:41,390
Often when you need to help somebody,

1261
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:45,860
the most important words they need to hear is, I love you and

1262
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:50,240
I accept you as you are and I'm praying for you.

1263
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,680
That's really what they need to hear, right? Or I'm sorry,

1264
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,520
right? And you know, in the church today,

1265
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:04,900
there was a institution that was

1266
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:08,510
set up or there was a. What's that word I'm trying

1267
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:09,370
to look for?

1268
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:15,130
Sabbath is a.

1269
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,678
Okay, never mind. There. There is. You know,

1270
01:26:19,734 --> 01:26:24,130
communion was given to us to teach us reconciliation,

1271
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:28,930
right? And today we have made communion a ceremony,

1272
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:35,006
right? We treat communion like the Jews treated Passover

1273
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:39,278
and the sacrifices. It had become an empty

1274
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:43,310
ceremony, right? Why? Because Ellen White says we

1275
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:47,214
should not go into communion unless

1276
01:26:47,262 --> 01:26:49,490
we have reconciled in the foot washing.

1277
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:53,966
Right? But the problem is we do foot washing for

1278
01:26:54,038 --> 01:26:57,598
10, 15 minutes. How in the

1279
01:26:57,654 --> 01:27:01,202
world are you going to reconcile with

1280
01:27:01,386 --> 01:27:05,746
the people you need to reconcile with in your congregation

1281
01:27:05,938 --> 01:27:08,978
in 15 minutes, right?

1282
01:27:09,114 --> 01:27:11,794
And most of us, we're not going to have the time during the week to

1283
01:27:11,802 --> 01:27:15,790
do it either, right? And so as a church, we have

1284
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:19,922
just made communion, you know,

1285
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:22,910
a ceremony that we just get through,

1286
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:27,950
but it was supposed to teach us once a quarter to reconcile

1287
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:31,758
all our differences in the church so that by the time

1288
01:27:31,814 --> 01:27:35,486
you get to communion, many, many hours later,

1289
01:27:35,558 --> 01:27:39,310
at least that's the way that we do it in our church. You are having

1290
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:42,974
a celebration because people who are sitting

1291
01:27:43,022 --> 01:27:47,090
on either side of the aisle who agree to disagree

1292
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:50,990
have actually reconciled and they're sitting together and

1293
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:54,404
there is love that's flowing through the heart, right?

1294
01:27:54,492 --> 01:27:57,924
A lot of the. The reason why a lot of our churches are not growing

1295
01:27:58,052 --> 01:28:01,716
are not, and God is not bringing people into the church to hear the truth

1296
01:28:01,828 --> 01:28:05,252
is because they might see the truth that there is

1297
01:28:05,276 --> 01:28:08,196
no love, right? And First John,

1298
01:28:08,348 --> 01:28:12,196
the book of First John deals with this, right? John says, the apostle

1299
01:28:12,228 --> 01:28:15,160
John says, if there is no love between a brother,

1300
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:19,508
then Jesus is not abiding. Doesn't matter whether you come into church

1301
01:28:19,524 --> 01:28:23,442
on the Sabbath, it doesn't matter whether you are claiming

1302
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:27,202
to know the mark of the beast. Doesn't matter whether you know Daniel

1303
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:30,722
and Revelation. If there is no love in the church, that is,

1304
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:34,546
there is no constant reconciliation

1305
01:28:34,578 --> 01:28:38,050
in the church, then there is no power because

1306
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:41,378
there is no love. Right. And a lack of love

1307
01:28:41,514 --> 01:28:44,754
neutralizes. Right. So this is one of the clear

1308
01:28:44,842 --> 01:28:48,588
evidences that a lack of love, a lack

1309
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:50,640
of unity amongst brethren,

1310
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:55,068
neutralizes God's ability, not God's

1311
01:28:55,084 --> 01:28:58,412
ability, God's ability to

1312
01:28:58,436 --> 01:29:01,340
be able to help answer our prayers. Right.

1313
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:05,840
God cannot answer the prayers of somebody who is not reconciled.

1314
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,692
Right. And so as a church, we need to learn. We need to practice

1315
01:29:09,756 --> 01:29:13,574
the habit of saying sorry. We need to learn to say sorry more.

1316
01:29:13,662 --> 01:29:15,410
We do not say sorry enough.

1317
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:20,998
Many just agree to live for decades in the same church,

1318
01:29:21,174 --> 01:29:24,422
just disagreeing with each other, just hating each

1319
01:29:24,446 --> 01:29:28,502
other, silently just speaking evil of each other from

1320
01:29:28,526 --> 01:29:32,502
the privacy of their homes and never coming together to deal

1321
01:29:32,606 --> 01:29:35,894
with reconciliation. So this is also one of

1322
01:29:35,902 --> 01:29:39,690
the most powerful blockages to answers a prayer that I have

1323
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:43,034
seen. Right. So for those who are praying for others,

1324
01:29:43,202 --> 01:29:47,162
sometimes it is also that lack of reconciliation that we need

1325
01:29:47,186 --> 01:29:51,150
to practice. Right. Or the lack of forgiveness.

1326
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:55,770
Okay, any other questions before we

1327
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:56,990
go into prayer?

1328
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:02,150
Yes. Can we pass the mic over?

1329
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:05,260
It's over there. It's okay.

1330
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,648
Okay, back to the Speak it in tongues.

1331
01:30:08,824 --> 01:30:12,456
Okay. How can it be in the Bible

1332
01:30:12,648 --> 01:30:16,072
and be a good thing and a bad thing? And how do

1333
01:30:16,096 --> 01:30:20,376
you know the difference? Sure. Okay, so there are six Bible texts.

1334
01:30:20,488 --> 01:30:22,904
So we're going off topic here. Kind of off topic,

1335
01:30:22,952 --> 01:30:26,120
but, you know, I'll answer it for you. There are

1336
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,340
six Bible texts in the Bible that speak about speaking in tongues.

1337
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,470
There are hundreds that speak about the Sabbath.

1338
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:37,266
Right. And so to hang a doctrine on six Bible texts,

1339
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:41,202
of which two are definitely against the

1340
01:30:41,226 --> 01:30:45,170
way it's being done in the Pentecostal Church today is dangerous territory.

1341
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:49,090
Okay. So the way that we should study the Bible is that all

1342
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:52,642
the Bible texts should align. Okay? So in

1343
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:55,920
the Book of Acts, there are two instances of speaking in tongues.

1344
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:00,596
One is at Pentecost. At Pentecost, Peter preaches

1345
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:04,320
in his tongue Hebrew, and everybody hears him.

1346
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:08,340
Right? So everybody who should not understand

1347
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,516
Hebrew, Right? Meaning that it is an unknown tongue

1348
01:31:12,548 --> 01:31:15,844
to them, they suddenly understand. Does that

1349
01:31:15,852 --> 01:31:18,900
make sense? Yes. Okay. The next instance of it is when

1350
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,642
Cornelius comes. Peter comes to meet Cornelius.

1351
01:31:21,656 --> 01:31:24,710
Cornelius and Peter speaks Hebrew.

1352
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:28,614
Cornelius speaks Roman language. Neither of

1353
01:31:28,622 --> 01:31:31,850
them can understand each other. So at that moment,

1354
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:36,438
they're given the gift of tongues. Both of them. Okay. And so

1355
01:31:36,494 --> 01:31:40,502
Peter now speaks in Hebrew, and he preaches the Gospel to Cornelius

1356
01:31:40,566 --> 01:31:44,570
and his family. And Cornelius hears it in the Roman language.

1357
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:48,958
And then Cornelius speaks back to Peter, asking questions

1358
01:31:49,094 --> 01:31:53,294
as he's teaching, and Peter can hear him

1359
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:57,086
in his Hebrew language. So both are given the gift

1360
01:31:57,118 --> 01:32:00,478
of tongues so that they can speak to one another. And the

1361
01:32:00,534 --> 01:32:04,334
purpose is for the conversion of Cornelius

1362
01:32:04,382 --> 01:32:08,158
and his family. The purpose of Peter being able to speak in tongues

1363
01:32:08,254 --> 01:32:12,610
is for the conversion of all that came for the Passover.

1364
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:17,112
Now we go to the book of 1 Corinthians, and we have

1365
01:32:17,216 --> 01:32:20,872
speaking in an unknown tongue. Right?

1366
01:32:20,976 --> 01:32:23,700
Now, Corinth is a port,

1367
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,976
and much like most of our cities today, the capital cities

1368
01:32:28,008 --> 01:32:31,832
of the world, all sorts of nationalities came

1369
01:32:31,936 --> 01:32:35,112
through the Church of Corinth. And so

1370
01:32:35,136 --> 01:32:38,440
you had people from all over the world in their ships coming

1371
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,462
through. And what was happening in the Church of Corinth?

1372
01:32:41,536 --> 01:32:45,290
Because the letter to the Church of Corinth is about church

1373
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:48,890
organization. And what is happening is people are getting on

1374
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:52,458
stage and they are preaching in their

1375
01:32:52,514 --> 01:32:56,666
tongue, which is an unknown tongue to everybody

1376
01:32:56,698 --> 01:33:00,042
else in the congregation. Right? That's one way to look

1377
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:03,546
at it. If I'm to line it up consistently with the Book of Acts,

1378
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:07,204
then when they are talking about an unknown tongue in. In the

1379
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:10,996
Book of First Corinthians, it is an unknown tongue to everybody

1380
01:33:11,028 --> 01:33:14,800
sitting in the congregation. So Paul is simply saying this.

1381
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:19,476
If you are speaking Malay

1382
01:33:19,668 --> 01:33:23,892
or Chinese and you are being asked to do a spiritual

1383
01:33:23,956 --> 01:33:27,748
warfare seminar, and you get up and you speak to

1384
01:33:27,804 --> 01:33:31,236
everybody in Chinese language, it is an unknown tongue

1385
01:33:31,268 --> 01:33:34,942
to everybody. If you're going to do that, please get up

1386
01:33:34,966 --> 01:33:38,702
with an interpreter. But if you don't have an

1387
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:42,798
interpreter, the only person that you are blessing and edifying

1388
01:33:42,894 --> 01:33:46,302
is yourself, right? Because I know what I

1389
01:33:46,326 --> 01:33:49,966
want to share, and it's blessing me, but it ain't blessing

1390
01:33:49,998 --> 01:33:54,030
any of you, so please don't do it. So in

1391
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,438
that principle alone, the Pentecostals are doing

1392
01:33:57,494 --> 01:34:00,984
wrong, right? Because they're getting up on stage and they're blabbering

1393
01:34:01,032 --> 01:34:04,808
all sorts of unknown tongues, and Paul is saying, please don't

1394
01:34:04,824 --> 01:34:08,280
get up on stage and do that kind of thing, right? So on that

1395
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,720
principle alone, they're wrong already. Even whether it's a

1396
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,920
known tongue, unknown tongue, language of the angels,

1397
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,408
whatever it is, they're breaking the principle of First

1398
01:34:18,464 --> 01:34:21,768
Corinthians already. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay,

1399
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:25,136
so say, for instance, like it happened

1400
01:34:25,168 --> 01:34:29,040
to me when I was a child, My mom was very introverted and

1401
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,880
shy and she didn't talk to anybody. She started speaking

1402
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:37,280
in tongues. Pentecostal, sure. And her

1403
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,880
brother was the same way. Quiet, introverted, didn't really

1404
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,352
talk to anybody. Okay. He interpreted it a

1405
01:34:44,376 --> 01:34:47,696
few minutes later after she spoke it. Okay.

1406
01:34:47,888 --> 01:34:51,502
Yeah, that's very easy for me to explain that to you. Yes. Based on

1407
01:34:51,526 --> 01:34:54,450
the principle of how I've been helping the Pentecostals.

1408
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:58,730
The demon that went into her to help her to speak tongues then went into

1409
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:03,326
the brother and told him what she said. That's it.

1410
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:06,130
Right, but according to the Bible,

1411
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:10,654
that's not biblical. Right. According to the Bible, there's only

1412
01:35:10,742 --> 01:35:14,174
one way that the gift of tongues was given. Number one,

1413
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:18,776
to preach the gospel in a land where nobody understands

1414
01:35:18,808 --> 01:35:22,420
what you're saying. And you've got to get the gospel message out.

1415
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,008
Right. That's the reason and basis for the gift of

1416
01:35:26,064 --> 01:35:29,656
tongues in the first place. Secondly, if you're

1417
01:35:29,688 --> 01:35:33,352
going to speak in a tongue that nobody knows and you don't have the

1418
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,776
gift of tongues at that time, please get somebody up here

1419
01:35:36,848 --> 01:35:40,360
to interpret for you. That's it. Right.

1420
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,220
It's really simple about what the Bible is trying to talk about.

1421
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,132
They're, you know, there's no added benefit in speaking in

1422
01:35:47,156 --> 01:35:51,452
the tongues of the language of angels here on earth,

1423
01:35:51,596 --> 01:35:55,932
Right. It would be beneficial for us up in heaven. But seriously,

1424
01:35:56,076 --> 01:36:00,556
nobody's getting converted by you speaking in the tongues of angels

1425
01:36:00,748 --> 01:36:04,396
if we just use our common sense, Right. So there's no benefit

1426
01:36:04,428 --> 01:36:07,852
for that whatsoever. And so the spirit that is coming out as a

1427
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:11,342
result of the speaking in tongues in the Pentecostal churches, based on my

1428
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:15,410
experience with deliverance, is demons.

1429
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:19,822
Right? And so as a result, then they start to. As they get more and

1430
01:36:19,846 --> 01:36:23,070
more involved, and in this period of time now, maybe in

1431
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:26,862
previous generations, they said, you know what, Speaking in tongues is enough. But now

1432
01:36:26,886 --> 01:36:31,406
they're stepping it up and they're starting to do a lot of harassment,

1433
01:36:31,598 --> 01:36:35,598
Right? And so a lot of them that have come to me, they're starting

1434
01:36:35,614 --> 01:36:39,270
to get harassed. There's things happening in their homes.

1435
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:43,070
They're getting illnesses or,

1436
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:46,770
you know, all sorts of torture. And so

1437
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:50,610
as they. As I lead them through the confession of that and they surrender

1438
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:54,242
that understanding of the gift of tongues, they get

1439
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:58,162
freedom from the enemy. Does that

1440
01:36:58,266 --> 01:37:02,210
answer your question? Thank you. Okay, no worries. All right,

1441
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:05,902
so let's take the time now, and if you have any further questions,

1442
01:37:06,046 --> 01:37:09,742
let us. I'll answer them individually after this. But once

1443
01:37:09,766 --> 01:37:13,262
again, I want to invite you to kneel with me. And if God

1444
01:37:13,326 --> 01:37:17,486
is impressing you if the Holy Spirit is impressing you to confess

1445
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:21,010
any sort of occult involvement,

1446
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:25,038
please spend that time to confess. And then we'll end with

1447
01:37:25,094 --> 01:37:27,930
prayer and we'll end the. End the meeting as well.

1448
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,744
Strongholds as well. Yes, vows,

1449
01:37:30,792 --> 01:37:34,216
strongholds, occult stuff in your

1450
01:37:34,368 --> 01:37:37,912
life, you know, confess that if

1451
01:37:37,936 --> 01:37:41,512
you can whisper it out so that the

1452
01:37:41,536 --> 01:37:45,096
reason why I want you to whisper it out or move your mouth silently.

1453
01:37:45,128 --> 01:37:49,144
You don't have to be audible, but move it silently

1454
01:37:49,272 --> 01:37:53,064
so that the demons will hear it. Right. And that confession.

1455
01:37:53,112 --> 01:37:56,782
And then as we rebuke them and command them out, you know,

1456
01:37:56,806 --> 01:38:00,270
the demons will hear that you have confessed Jesus as

1457
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:03,790
well. Okay. So when you're dealing with demons, it's important.

1458
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:07,246
And when you're rebuking them, using Bible texts to rebuke them,

1459
01:38:07,318 --> 01:38:10,670
it's important to speak audibly because they can't read our

1460
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:15,090
minds. Right. And so they need to hear that. Okay, let's pray.

1461
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:19,950
Father in heaven, I thank youk for being with us as

1462
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:23,070
we have looked at the topic of open doors this

1463
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:27,970
evening. And Lord, as we've touched this topic of occult involvement,

1464
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,950
I pray, Father, that your Holy Spirit, I thank you, that your

1465
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,598
spirit has been convicting our hearts and bringing to our minds things

1466
01:38:35,654 --> 01:38:39,790
that we need to confess so that we can be free from

1467
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:44,050
the bondage of the enemy, so that we can be free from their attacks.

1468
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:48,708
And Father, I just pray at this very moment, may your Holy Spirit

1469
01:38:48,884 --> 01:38:52,580
give us the insight and also the courage

1470
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:57,160
to, and the desire in our hearts to confess these sins

1471
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:01,360
as we do it silently and individually now.

1472
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,212
Father in heaven, I thank youk. I thank youk

1473
01:42:36,236 --> 01:42:39,652
for your Holy Spirit. I thank you for the power of

1474
01:42:39,676 --> 01:42:43,080
the blood of Jesus that covers our sins.

1475
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:47,508
And I thank you for the healing that

1476
01:42:47,564 --> 01:42:51,044
you want to give to each one of us. And Father, as you have heard

1477
01:42:51,092 --> 01:42:54,404
the prayers of every individual here, I thank

1478
01:42:54,452 --> 01:42:58,148
you for the price that has been paid at the cross.

1479
01:42:58,324 --> 01:43:01,556
And I thank you, Lord, that as we have confessed,

1480
01:43:01,748 --> 01:43:05,570
you have forgiven us. And once again I claim

1481
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:08,978
1st John 1:9. And I thank you for your

1482
01:43:09,034 --> 01:43:12,370
forgiveness. I thank you for the blood of Jesus that covers our

1483
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:15,586
sins. And I thank you for the righteousness of Christ that now covers

1484
01:43:15,618 --> 01:43:18,402
us, that we are perfect in your sight.

1485
01:43:18,546 --> 01:43:22,514
And because we have confessed, Lord, I pray

1486
01:43:22,562 --> 01:43:26,114
that you would please remove the demons from our

1487
01:43:26,122 --> 01:43:29,826
hearts, close the doors so they no longer have access.

1488
01:43:29,978 --> 01:43:33,554
And in the name of Jesus Christ, I command evil spirits

1489
01:43:33,682 --> 01:43:37,378
that have been here as a result of occult involvement or idolatry.

1490
01:43:37,474 --> 01:43:40,850
The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, And I command you

1491
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:43,890
in the name of Jesus to leave. Thank you Father,

1492
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:47,826
for the power of God and that your

1493
01:43:47,898 --> 01:43:51,282
love and your power is able

1494
01:43:51,306 --> 01:43:54,674
to save to the uttermost all who come to you.

1495
01:43:54,842 --> 01:43:57,768
And so Lord, we recommit our lives into your hands.

1496
01:43:57,864 --> 01:44:01,256
And I pray that you'll continue to work in our hearts. And I pray

1497
01:44:01,288 --> 01:44:04,248
Father, that you will fill us with the love of Jesus,

1498
01:44:04,424 --> 01:44:07,500
with his peace, with his joy,

1499
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,400
and that you will help us to continue to

1500
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,032
walk in the newness of life. And that you will give

1501
01:44:15,056 --> 01:44:18,776
us the power never to open those doors again. But Lord,

1502
01:44:18,808 --> 01:44:22,072
if we do, remind us that we should run to the

1503
01:44:22,096 --> 01:44:25,730
feet of Jesus. And as we confess immediately,

1504
01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:29,634
you will cleanse us and you will evict the demons. Once again,

1505
01:44:29,802 --> 01:44:33,586
thank you Father for hearing our prayer. Please bless our evening

1506
01:44:33,698 --> 01:44:37,474
and help us Lord to have safe journey home.

1507
01:44:37,642 --> 01:44:41,218
And I pray that you will please give us a good night's

1508
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:44,630
rest. For this we pray in Jesus loving name. Amen.

1509
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:50,908
Okay, thank you every everyone, and this concludes

1510
01:44:51,004 --> 01:44:54,764
our session for this evening. I would like to

1511
01:44:54,852 --> 01:44:58,396
invite you once again to come tomorrow evening.

1512
01:44:58,428 --> 01:45:02,240
We're going to go from 6:30 to 8:30pm

1513
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:07,884
and we'll be here once again. So I'll see you again tomorrow

1514
01:45:07,932 --> 01:45:11,772
evening. God bless you and we'll see you tomorrow. Oh,

1515
01:45:11,836 --> 01:45:15,182
you have the topic. Tomorrow we're going

1516
01:45:15,206 --> 01:45:18,450
to look at how to have victory,

1517
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:22,942
right? So what does it mean? Once we've confessed our open doors

1518
01:45:23,086 --> 01:45:27,086
and we've invited Jesus into our lives and we're

1519
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:30,398
attacked once again, how can we have victory?

1520
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:34,030
Right. What are the things, what are the tools and the weapons of

1521
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,630
warfare that God has given to us that we

1522
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:40,990
can use to go on the offensive against

1523
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:44,900
the enemy? Right. And both in terms of helping somebody as

1524
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:48,068
well as in terms of defending ourselves

1525
01:45:48,164 --> 01:45:51,892
as well. Right. So when those negative thoughts come, what do we need to

1526
01:45:51,916 --> 01:45:55,620
do? And we'll go in through that and we'll also look at how Jesus was

1527
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:59,364
attacked. So we're going to look at the wilderness

1528
01:45:59,492 --> 01:46:03,108
experience that Jesus had and how the devil attacked him

1529
01:46:03,244 --> 01:46:07,172
and then how he defended himself. Right. How he was

1530
01:46:07,196 --> 01:46:10,280
able to rely on God to defend himself. So we'll break that

1531
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,540
down as well.
